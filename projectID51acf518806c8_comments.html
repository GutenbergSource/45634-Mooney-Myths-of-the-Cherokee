<HTML><BODY>A large collection of Cherokee myths that originally appeared in the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/wiki/BAE">BAE</a> (Bureau of American Ethnology) publication, vol. 19.

<p>Although old (in PGDP terms), the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/wiki/BAE/Formatting">BAE Formatting</a> still apply. In particular, carefully take care of the various types of primes and apostrophes being used in this text.

<p>With over 600 pages of tightly set text and many uncommon accents, the work will not always be easy, but this is certainly an interesting and worthwhile text.

<p>Have fun!</BODY></HTML>
