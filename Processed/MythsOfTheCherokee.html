<h2 class="super">MYTHS OF THE CHEROKEE</h2>
<p class="byline">By <span class="sc">James Mooney</span></p>
<h2 class="main">I&mdash;INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The myths given in this paper are part of a large body
of material collected among the Cherokee, chiefly in successive field
seasons from 1887 to 1890, inclusive, and comprising more or less
extensive notes, together with original Cherokee manuscripts, relating
to the history, archeology, geographic nomenclature, personal names,
botany, medicine, arts, home life, religion, songs, ceremonies, and
language of the tribe. It is intended that this material shall appear
from time to time in a series of papers which, when finally brought
together, shall constitute a monograph upon the Cherokee Indians. This
paper may be considered the first of the series, all that has hitherto
appeared being a short paper upon the sacred formulas of the tribe,
published in the Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau in 1891 and
containing a synopsis of the Cherokee medico-religious theory, with
twenty-eight specimens selected from a body of about six hundred ritual
formulas written down in the Cherokee language and alphabet by former
doctors of the tribe and constituting altogether the largest body of
aboriginal American literature in existence.</p>
<p>Although the Cherokee are probably the largest and most important
tribe in the United States, having their own national government and
numbering at any time in their history from 20,000 to 25,000 persons,
almost nothing has yet been written of their history or general
ethnology, as compared with the literature of such northern tribes as
the Delawares, the Iroquois, or the Ojibwa. The difference is due to
historical reasons which need not be discussed here.</p>
<p>It might seem at first thought that the Cherokee, with their
civilized code of laws, their national press, their schools and
seminaries, are so far advanced along the white man&rsquo;s road as to
offer but little inducement for ethnologic study. This is largely true
of those in the Indian Territory, with whom the enforced deportation,
two generations ago, from accustomed scenes and surroundings did more
at a single stroke to obliterate Indian ideas than could have been
accomplished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>by fifty years of slow development. There remained
behind, however, in the heart of the Carolina mountains, a considerable
body, outnumbering today such well-known western tribes as the Omaha,
Pawnee, Comanche, and Kiowa, and it is among these, the old
conservative Kitu&prime;hwa element, that the ancient things have been
preserved. Mountaineers guard well the past, and in the secluded
forests of Nantahala and Oconaluftee, far away from the main-traveled
road of modern progress, the Cherokee priest still treasures the
legends and repeats the mystic rituals handed down from his ancestors.
There is change indeed in dress and outward seeming, but the heart of
the Indian is still his own.</p>
<p>For this and other reasons much the greater portion of the material
herein contained has been procured among the East Cherokee living upon
the Qualla reservation in western North Carolina and in various
detached settlements between the reservation and the Tennessee line.
This has been supplemented with information obtained in the Cherokee
Nation in Indian Territory, chiefly from old men and women who had
emigrated from what is now Tennessee and Georgia, and who consequently
had a better local knowledge of these sections, as well as of the
history of the western Nation, than is possessed by their kindred in
Carolina. The historical matter and the parallels are, of course,
collated chiefly from printed sources, but the myths proper, with but
few exceptions, are from original investigation.</p>
<p>The historical sketch must be understood as distinctly a sketch, not
a detailed narrative, for which there is not space in the present
paper. The Cherokee have made deep impress upon the history of the
southern states, and no more has been attempted here than to give the
leading facts in connected sequence. As the history of the Nation after
the removal to the West and the reorganization in Indian Territory
presents but few points of ethnologic interest, it has been but briefly
treated. On the other hand the affairs of the eastern band have been
discussed at some length, for the reason that so little concerning this
remnant is to be found in print.</p>
<p>One of the chief purposes of ethnologic study is to trace the
development of human thought under varying conditions of race and
environment, the result showing always that primitive man is
essentially the same in every part of the world. With this object in
view a considerable space has been devoted to parallels drawn almost
entirely from Indian tribes of the United States and British America.
For the southern countries there is but little trustworthy material,
and to extend the inquiry to the eastern continent and the islands of
the sea would be to invite an endless task.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Cherokee were the mountaineers of the South,
holding the entire Allegheny region from the interlocking head-streams
of the Kanawha and the Tennessee southward almost to the site of
Atlanta, and from the Blue ridge on the east to the Cumberland range on
the west, a territory comprising an area of about 40,000 square miles,
now included in the states of Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. Their principal towns were upon
the headwaters of the Savannah, Hiwassee, and Tuckasegee, and along the
whole length of the Little Tennessee to its junction with the main
stream. Its&acirc;t&#301;, or Echota, on the south bank of the Little
Tennessee, a few miles above the mouth of Tellico river, in Tennessee,
was commonly considered the capital of the Nation. As the advancing
whites pressed upon them from the east and northeast the more exposed
towns were destroyed or abandoned and new settlements were formed lower
down the Tennessee and on the upper branches of the Chattahoochee and
the Coosa.</p>
<p>As is always the case with tribal geography, there were no fixed
boundaries, and on every side the Cherokee frontiers were contested by
rival claimants. In Virginia, there is reason to believe, the tribe was
held in check in early days by the Powhatan and the Monacan. On the
east and southeast the Tuscarora and Catawba were their inveterate
enemies, with hardly even a momentary truce within the historic period;
and evidence goes to show that the Sara or Cheraw were fully as
hostile. On the south there was hereditary war with the Creeks, who
claimed nearly the whole of upper Georgia as theirs by original
possession, but who were being gradually pressed down toward the Gulf
until, through the mediation of the United States, a treaty was finally
made fixing the boundary between the two tribes along a line running
about due west from the mouth of Broad river on the Savannah. Toward
the west, the Chickasaw on the lower Tennessee and the Shawano on the
Cumberland repeatedly turned back the tide of Cherokee invasion from
the rich central valleys, while the powerful Iroquois in the far north
set up an almost unchallenged claim of paramount lordship from the
Ottawa river of Canada southward at least to the Kentucky river.</p>

<p>On the other hand, by their defeat of the Creeks and expulsion of
the Shawano, the Cherokee made good the claim which they asserted to
all the lands from upper Georgia to the Ohio river, including the rich
hunting grounds of Kentucky. Holding as they did the great mountain
barrier between the English settlements on the coast and the French or
Spanish garrisons along the Mississippi and the Ohio, their geographic
position, no less than their superior number, would have given them the
balance of power in the South but for a looseness of tribal
organization in striking contrast to the compactness of the Iroquois
league, by which for more than a century the French power was held in
check in the north. The English, indeed, found it convenient to
recognize certain chiefs as supreme in the tribe, but the only real
attempt to weld the whole Cherokee Nation into a political unit was
that made by the French agent, Priber, about 1736, which failed from
its premature discovery by the English. We frequently find their
kingdom divided against itself, their very number preventing unity of
action, while still giving them an importance above that of neighboring
tribes.</p>
<p>The proper name by which the Cherokee call themselves (1)<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1705src" href="#xd25e1705" name="xd25e1705src">1</a>
is Y&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;wiy&#259;&prime;, or
Ani&prime;-Y&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;wiy&#259;&prime; in the third person,
signifying &ldquo;real people,&rdquo; or &ldquo;principal
people,&rdquo; a word closely related to O&ntilde;we-ho&ntilde;we, the
name by which the cognate Iroquois know themselves. The word properly
denotes &ldquo;Indians,&rdquo; as distinguished from people of other
races, but in usage it is restricted to mean members of the Cherokee
tribe, those of other tribes being designated as Creek, Catawba, etc.,
as the case may be. On ceremonial occasions they frequently speak of
themselves as Ani&prime;-Kitu&prime;hwag&#301;, or &ldquo;people of
K&#301;tu&prime;hwa,&rdquo; an ancient settlement on Tuckasegee river
and apparently the original nucleus of the tribe. Among the western
Cherokee this name has been adopted by a secret society recruited from
the full-blood element and pledged to resist the advances of the white
man&rsquo;s civilization. Under the various forms of Cuttawa,
Gattochwa, Kittuwa, etc., as spelled by different authors, it was also
used by several northern Algonquian tribes as a synonym for
Cherokee.</p>
<p>Cherokee, the name by which they are commonly known, has no meaning
in their own language, and seems to be of foreign origin. As used among
themselves the form is Tsa&prime;l&#259;g&#301;&prime; or
Tsa&prime;r&#259;g&#301;&prime;. It first appears as Chalaque in the
Portuguese narrative of De Soto&rsquo;s expedition, published
originally in 1557, while we find Cheraqui in a French document of
1699, and Cherokee as an English form as early, at least, as 1708. The
name has thus an authentic history of 360 years. There is evidence that
it is derived from the Choctaw word <i>choluk</i> or <i>chiluk</i>,
signifying a pit or cave, and comes to us through the so-called
Mobilian trade language, a corrupted Choctaw jargon formerly used as
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>medium of communication among all the tribes of
the Gulf states, as far north as the mouth of the Ohio (2). Within this
area many of the tribes were commonly known under Choctaw names, even
though of widely differing linguistic stocks, and if such a name
existed for the Cherokee it must undoubtedly have been communicated to
the first Spanish explorers by De Soto&rsquo;s interpreters. This
theory is borne out by their Iroquois (Mohawk) name,
Oyata&#700;ge&#699;rono&ntilde;&#700;, as given by Hewitt, signifying
&ldquo;inhabitants of the cave country,&rdquo; the Allegheny region
being peculiarly a cave country, in which &ldquo;rock shelters,&rdquo;
containing numerous traces of Indian occupancy, are of frequent
occurrence. Their Catawba name also, Ma&ntilde;tera&ntilde;, as given
by Gatschet, signifying &ldquo;coming out of the ground,&rdquo; seems
to contain the same reference. Adair&rsquo;s attempt to connect the
name Cherokee with their word for fire, <i>atsila</i>, is an error
founded upon imperfect knowledge of the language.</p>
<p>Among other synonyms for the tribe are Rickahockan, or Rechahecrian,
the ancient Powhatan name, and Tallige&prime;, or Tallige&prime;wi, the
ancient name used in the Walam Olum chronicle of the Lenape&prime;.
Concerning both the application and the etymology of this last name
there has been much dispute, but there seems no reasonable doubt as to
the identity of the people.</p>
<p>Linguistically the Cherokee belong to the Iroquoian stock, the
relationship having been suspected by Barton over a century ago, and by
Gallatin and Hale at a later period, and definitely established by
Hewitt in 1887.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1725src" href="#xd25e1725"
name="xd25e1725src">2</a> While there can now be no question of the
connection, the marked lexical and grammatical differences indicate
that the separation must have occurred at a very early period. As is
usually the case with a large tribe occupying an extensive territory,
the language is spoken in several dialects, the principal of which may,
for want of other names, be conveniently designated as the Eastern,
Middle, and Western. Adair&rsquo;s classification into
&ldquo;Ayrate&rdquo; (<i>e&prime;lad&#301;</i>), or low, and
&ldquo;Ottare&rdquo; (<i>&acirc;&prime;tal&#301;</i>), or mountainous,
must be rejected as imperfect.</p>
<p>The Eastern dialect, formerly often called the Lower Cherokee
dialect, was originally spoken in all the towns upon the waters of the
Keowee and Tugaloo, head-streams of Savannah river, in South Carolina
and the adjacent portion of Georgia. Its chief peculiarity is a rolling
<i>r</i>, which takes the place of the <i>l</i> of the other dialects.
In this dialect the tribal name is Tsa&prime;r&#259;g&#301;&prime;,
which the English settlers of Carolina corrupted to Cherokee, while the
Spaniards, advancing from the south, became better familiar with the
other form, which they wrote as Chalaque. Owing to their exposed
frontier position, adjoining the white settlements of Carolina, the
Cherokee of this division <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href=
"#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>were the first to feel the shock of
war in the campaigns of 1760 and 1776, with the result that before the
close of the Revolution they had been completely extirpated from their
original territory and scattered as refugees among the more western
towns of the tribe. The consequence was that they lost their
distinctive dialect, which is now practically extinct. In 1888 it was
spoken by but one man on the reservation in North Carolina.</p>
<p>The Middle dialect, which might properly be designated the Kituhwa
dialect, was originally spoken in the towns on the Tuckasegee and the
headwaters of the Little Tennessee, in the very heart of the Cherokee
country, and is still spoken by the great majority of those now living
on the Qualla reservation. In some of its phonetic forms it agrees with
the Eastern dialect, but resembles the Western in having the <i>l</i>
sound.</p>
<p>The Western dialect was spoken in most of the towns of east
Tennessee and upper Georgia and upon Hiwassee and Cheowa rivers in
North Carolina. It is the softest and most musical of all the dialects
of this musical language, having a frequent liquid <i>l</i> and eliding
many of the harsher consonants found in the other forms. It is also the
literary dialect, and is spoken by most of those now constituting the
Cherokee Nation in the West.</p>
<p>Scattered among the other Cherokee are individuals whose
pronunciation and occasional peculiar terms for familiar objects give
indication of a fourth and perhaps a fifth dialect, which can not now
be localized. It is possible that these differences may come from
foreign admixture, as of Natchez, Taskigi, or Shawano blood. There is
some reason for believing that the people living on Nantahala river
differed dialectically from their neighbors on either side (3).</p>
<p>The Iroquoian stock, to which the Cherokee belong, had its chief
home in the north, its tribes occupying a compact territory which
comprised portions of Ontario, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and
extended down the Susquehanna and Chesapeake bay almost to the latitude
of Washington. Another body, including the Tuscarora, Nottoway, and
perhaps also the Meherrin, occupied territory in northeastern North
Carolina and the adjacent portion of Virginia. The Cherokee themselves
constituted the third and southernmost body. It is evident that tribes
of common stock must at one time have occupied contiguous territories,
and such we find to be the case in this instance. The Tuscarora and
Meherrin, and presumably also the Nottoway, are known to have come from
the north, while traditional and historical evidence concur in
assigning to the Cherokee as their early home the region about the
headwaters of the Ohio, immediately to the southward of their kinsmen,
but bitter enemies, the Iroquois. The theory which brings the Cherokee
from northern Iowa and the Iroquois from Manitoba is unworthy of
serious consideration. (4)</p>
<p>The most ancient tradition concerning the Cherokee appears to be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>the Delaware tradition of the expulsion of the
Talligewi from the north, as first noted by the missionary Heckewelder
in 1819, and published more fully by Brinton in the Walam Olum in 1885.
According to the first account, the Delawares, advancing from the west,
found their further progress opposed by a powerful people called
Alligewi or Talligewi, occupying the country upon a river which
Heckewelder thinks identical with the Mississippi, but which the sequel
shows was more probably the upper Ohio. They were said to have
regularly built earthen fortifications, in which they defended
themselves so well that at last the Delawares were obliged to seek the
assistance of the &ldquo;Mengwe,&rdquo; or Iroquois, with the result
that after a warfare extending over many years the Alligewi finally
received a crushing defeat, the survivors fleeing down the river and
abandoning the country to the invaders, who thereupon parceled it out
amongst themselves, the &ldquo;Mengwe&rdquo; choosing the portion about
the Great lakes while the Delawares took possession of that to the
south and east. The missionary adds that the Allegheny (and Ohio) river
was still called by the Delawares the Alligewi Sipu, or river of the
Alligewi. This would seem to indicate it as the true river of the
tradition. He speaks also of remarkable earthworks seen by him in 1789
in the neighborhood of Lake Erie, which were said by the Indians to
have been built by the extirpated tribe as defensive fortifications in
the course of this war. Near two of these, in the vicinity of Sandusky,
he was shown mounds under which it was said some hundreds of the slain
Talligewi were buried.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1766src" href=
"#xd25e1766" name="xd25e1766src">3</a> As is usual in such traditions,
the Alligewi were said to have been of giant stature, far exceeding
their conquerors in size.</p>
<p>In the Walam Olum, which is, it is asserted, a metrical translation
of an ancient hieroglyphic bark record discovered in 1820, the main
tradition is given in practically the same way, with an appendix which
follows the fortunes of the defeated tribe up to the beginning of the
historic period, thus completing the chain of evidence. (5)</p>
<p>In the Walam Olum also we find the Delawares advancing from the west
or northwest until they come to &ldquo;Fish river&rdquo;&mdash;the same
which Heckewelder makes the Mississippi (6). On the other side, we are
told, &ldquo;The Talligewi possessed the East.&rdquo; The Delaware
chief &ldquo;desired the eastern land,&rdquo; and some of his people go
on, but are killed, by the Talligewi. The Delawares decide upon war and
call in the help of their northern friends, the
&ldquo;Talamatan,&rdquo; i. e., the Wyandot and other allied Iroquoian
tribes. A war ensues which continues through the terms of four
successive chiefs, when victory declares for the invaders, and
&ldquo;all the Talega go south.&rdquo; The country is then divided, the
Talamatan taking the northern portion, while the Delawares &ldquo;stay
south of the lakes.&rdquo; The chronicle proceeds to tell how, after
eleven more chiefs have ruled, the Nanticoke and Shawano separate from
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>parent tribe and remove to the south. Six other
chiefs follow in succession until we come to the seventh, who
&ldquo;went to the Talega mountains.&rdquo; By this time the Delawares
have reached the ocean. Other chiefs succeed, after whom &ldquo;the
Easterners and the Wolves&rdquo;&mdash;probably the Mahican or
Wappinger and the Munsee&mdash;move off to the northeast. At last,
after six more chiefs, &ldquo;the whites came on the eastern
sea,&rdquo; by which is probably meant the landing of the Dutch on
Manhattan in 1609 (7). We may consider this a tally date, approximating
the beginning of the seventeenth century. Two more chiefs rule, and of
the second we are told that &ldquo;He fought at the south; he fought in
the land of the Talega and Koweta,&rdquo; and again the fourth chief
after the coming of the whites &ldquo;went to the Talega.&rdquo; We
have thus a traditional record of a war of conquest carried on against
the Talligewi by four successive chiefs, and a succession of about
twenty-five chiefs between the final expulsion of that tribe and the
appearance of the whites, in which interval the Nanticoke, Shawano,
Mahican, and Munsee branched off from the parent tribe of the
Delawares. Without venturing to entangle ourselves in the devious maze
of Indian chronology, it is sufficient to note that all this implies a
very long period of time&mdash;so long, in fact, that during it several
new tribes, each of which in time developed a distinct dialect, branch
off from the main Lenape&prime; stem. It is distinctly stated that all
the Talega went south after their final defeat; and from later
references we find that they took refuge in the mountain country in the
neighborhood of the Koweta (the Creeks), and that Delaware war parties
were still making raids upon both these tribes long after the first
appearance of the whites.</p>
<p>Although at first glance it might be thought that the name
Tallige-wi is but a corruption of Tsalagi, a closer study leads to the
opinion that it is a true Delaware word, in all probability connected
with <i>waloh</i> or <i>walok</i>, signifying a cave or hole
(Zeisberger), whence we find in the Walam Olum the word
<i>oligonunk</i> rendered as &ldquo;at the place of caves.&rdquo; It
would thus be an exact Delaware rendering of the same name,
&ldquo;people of the cave country,&rdquo; by which, as we have seen,
the Cherokee were commonly known among the tribes. Whatever may be the
origin of the name itself, there can be no reasonable doubt as to its
application. &ldquo;Name, location, and legends combine to identify the
Cherokees or Tsalaki with the Tallike; and this is as much evidence as
we can expect to produce in such researches.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e1786src" href="#xd25e1786" name="xd25e1786src">4</a></p>
<p>The Wyandot confirm the Delaware story and fix the identification of
the expelled tribe. According to their tradition, as narrated in 1802,
the ancient fortifications in the Ohio valley had been erected in the
course of a long war between themselves and the Cherokee, which
resulted finally in the defeat of the latter.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1791src" href="#xd25e1791" name="xd25e1791src">5</a></p>
<p>The traditions of the Cherokee, so far as they have been preserved,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>supplement and corroborate those of the northern
tribes, thus bringing the story down to their final settlement upon the
headwaters of the Tennessee in the rich valleys of the southern
Alleghenies. Owing to the Cherokee predilection for new gods,
contrasting strongly with the conservatism of the Iroquois, their
ritual forms and national epics had fallen into decay even before the
Revolution, as we learn from Adair. Some vestiges of their migration
legend still existed in Haywood&rsquo;s time, but it is now completely
forgotten both in the East and in the West.</p>
<p>According to Haywood, who wrote in 1823 on information obtained
directly from leading members of the tribe long before the Removal, the
Cherokee formerly had a long migration legend, which was already lost,
but which, within the memory of the mother of one informant&mdash;say
about 1750&mdash;was still recited by chosen orators on the occasion of
the annual green-corn dance. This migration legend appears to have
resembled that of the Delawares and the Creeks in beginning with
genesis and the period of animal monsters, and thence following the
shifting fortune of the chosen band to the historic period. The
tradition recited that they had originated in a land toward the rising
sun, where they had been placed by the command of &ldquo;the four
councils sent from above.&rdquo; In this pristine home were great
snakes and water monsters, for which reason it was supposed to have
been near the sea-coast, although the assumption is not a necessary
corollary, as these are a feature of the mythology of all the eastern
tribes. After this genesis period there began a slow migration, during
which &ldquo;towns of people in many nights&rsquo; encampment
removed,&rdquo; but no details are given. From Heckewelder it appears
that the expression, &ldquo;a night&rsquo;s encampment,&rdquo; which
occurs also in the Delaware migration legend, is an Indian figure of
speech for a halt of one year at a place.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1800src" href="#xd25e1800" name="xd25e1800src">6</a></p>
<p>In another place Haywood says, although apparently confusing the
chronologic order of events: &ldquo;One tradition which they have
amongst them says they came from the west and exterminated the former
inhabitants; and then says they came from the upper parts of the Ohio,
where they erected the mounds on Grave creek, and that they removed
thither from the country where Monticello (near Charlottesville,
Virginia) is situated.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1805src" href=
"#xd25e1805" name="xd25e1805src">7</a> The first reference is to the
celebrated mounds on the Ohio near Moundsville, below Wheeling, West
Virginia; the other is doubtless to a noted burial mound described by
Jefferson in 1781 as then existing near his home, on the low grounds of
Rivanna river opposite the site of an ancient Indian town. He himself
had opened it and found it to contain perhaps a thousand disjointed
skeletons of both adults and children, the bones piled in successive
layers, those near the top being least decayed. They showed no signs
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>of violence, but were evidently the accumulation
of long years from the neighboring Indian town. The distinguished
writer adds: &ldquo;But on whatever occasion they may have been made,
they are of considerable notoriety among the Indians: for a party
passing, about thirty years ago [i. e., about 1750], through the part
of the country where this barrow is, went through the woods directly to
it without any instructions or enquiry, and having staid about it some
time, with expressions which were construed to be those of sorrow, they
returned to the high road, which they had left about half a dozen miles
to pay this visit, and pursued their journey.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e1810src" href="#xd25e1810" name="xd25e1810src">8</a> Although
the tribe is not named, the Indians were probably Cherokee, as no other
southern Indians were then accustomed to range in that section. As
serving to corroborate this opinion we have the statement of a
prominent Cherokee chief, given to Schoolcraft in 1846, that
<span class="corr" id="xd25e1813" title=
"Source: acccording">according</span> to their tradition his people had
formerly lived at the Peaks of Otter, in Virginia, a noted landmark of
the Blue ridge, near the point where Staunton river breaks through the
mountains.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1816src" href="#xd25e1816" name=
"xd25e1816src">9</a></p>
<p>From a careful sifting of the evidence Haywood concludes that the
authors of the most ancient remains in Tennessee had spread over that
region from the south and southwest at a very early period, but that
the later occupants, the Cherokee, had entered it from the north and
northeast in comparatively recent times, overrunning and exterminating
the aborigines. He declares that the historical fact seems to be
established that the Cherokee entered the country from Virginia, making
temporary settlements upon New river and the upper Holston, until,
under the continued hostile pressure from the north, they were again
forced to remove farther to the south, fixing themselves upon the
Little Tennessee, in what afterward became known as the middle towns.
By a leading mixed blood of the tribe he was informed that they had
made their first settlements within their modern home territory upon
Nolichucky river, and that, having lived there for a long period, they
could give no definite account of an earlier location. Echota, their
capital and peace town, &ldquo;claimed to be the eldest brother in the
nation,&rdquo; and the claim was generally acknowledged.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1822src" href="#xd25e1822" name=
"xd25e1822src">10</a> In confirmation of the statement as to an early
occupancy of the upper Holston region, it may be noted that
&ldquo;Watauga Old Fields,&rdquo; now Elizabethtown, were so called
from the fact that when the first white settlement within the present
state of Tennessee was begun there, so early as 1769, the bottom lands
were found to contain graves and other numerous ancient remains of a
former Indian town which tradition ascribed to the Cherokee, whose
nearest settlements were then many miles to the southward.</p>
<p>While the Cherokee claimed to have built the mounds on the upper
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>Ohio, they yet, according to Haywood, expressly
disclaimed the authorship of the very numerous mounds and petroglyphs
in their later home territory, asserting that these ancient works had
exhibited the same appearance when they themselves had first occupied
the region.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1829src" href="#xd25e1829" name=
"xd25e1829src">11</a> This accords with Bartram&rsquo;s statement that
the Cherokee, although sometimes utilizing the mounds as sites for
their own town houses, were as ignorant as the whites of their origin
or purpose, having only a general tradition that their forefathers had
found them in much the same condition on first coming into the
country.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1832src" href="#xd25e1832" name=
"xd25e1832src">12</a></p>
<p>Although, as has been noted, Haywood expresses the opinion that the
invading Cherokee had overrun and exterminated the earlier inhabitants,
he says in another place, on halfbreed authority, that the newcomers
found no Indians upon the waters of the Tennessee, with the exception
of some Creeks living upon that river, near the mouth of the Hiwassee,
the main body of that tribe being established upon and claiming all the
streams to the southward.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1837src" href=
"#xd25e1837" name="xd25e1837src">13</a> There is considerable evidence
that the Creeks preceded the Cherokee, and within the last century they
still claimed the Tennessee, or at least the Tennessee watershed, for
their northern boundary.</p>
<p>There is a dim but persistent tradition of a strange white race
preceding the Cherokee, some of the stories even going so far as to
locate their former settlements and to identify them as the authors of
the ancient works found in the country. The earliest reference appears
to be that of Barton in 1797, on the statement of a gentleman whom he
quotes as a valuable authority upon the southern tribes. &ldquo;The
Cheerake tell us, that when they first arrived in the country which
they inhabit, they found it possessed by certain &lsquo;moon-eyed
people,&rsquo; who could not see in the day-time. These wretches they
expelled.&rdquo; He seems to consider them an albino race.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1842src" href="#xd25e1842" name=
"xd25e1842src">14</a> Haywood, twenty-six years later, says that the
invading Cherokee found &ldquo;white people&rdquo; near the head of the
Little Tennessee, with forts extending thence down the Tennessee as far
as Chickamauga creek. He gives the location of three of these forts.
The Cherokee made war against them and drove them to the mouth of Big
Chickamauga creek, where they entered into a treaty and agreed to
remove if permitted to depart in peace. Permission being granted, they
abandoned the country. Elsewhere he speaks of this extirpated white
race as having extended into Kentucky and probably also into western
Tennessee, according to the concurrent traditions of different tribes.
He describes their houses, on what authority is not stated, as having
been small circular structures <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23"
href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>of upright logs, covered with
earth which had been dug out from the inside.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Harry Smith, a halfbreed born about 1815, father of the late chief
of the East Cherokee, informed the author that when a boy he had been
told by an old woman a tradition of a race of very small people,
perfectly white, who once came and lived for some time on the site of
the ancient mound on the northern side of Hiwassee, at the mouth of
Peachtree creek, a few miles above the present Murphy, North Carolina.
They afterward removed to the West. Colonel Thomas, the white chief of
the East Cherokee, born about the beginning of the century, had also
heard a tradition of another race of people, who lived on Hiwassee,
opposite the present Murphy, and warned the Cherokee that they must not
attempt to cross over to the south side of the river or the great leech
in the water would swallow them.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1867src"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The definite history of the Cherokee begins with the
year 1540, at which date we find them already established, where they
were always afterward known, in the mountains of Carolina and Georgia.
The earliest Spanish adventurers failed to penetrate so far into the
interior, and the first entry into their country was made by De Soto,
advancing up the Savannah on his fruitless quest for gold, in May of
that year.</p>
<p>While at Cofitachiqui, an important Indian town on the lower
Savannah governed by a &ldquo;queen,&rdquo; the Spaniards had found
hatchets and other objects of copper, some of which was of finer color
and appeared to be mixed with gold, although they had no means of
testing it.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1879src" href="#xd25e1879" name=
"xd25e1879src">17</a> On inquiry they were told that the metal had come
from an interior mountain province called Chisca, but the country was
represented as thinly peopled and the way as impassable for horses.
Some time before, while advancing through eastern Georgia, they had
heard also of a rich and plentiful province called Co&ccedil;a, toward
the northwest, and by the people of Cofitachiqui they were now told
that Chiaha, the nearest town of Co&ccedil;a province, was twelve days
inland. As both men and animals were already nearly exhausted from
hunger and hard travel, and the Indians either could not or would not
furnish sufficient provision for their needs, De Soto determined not to
attempt the passage of the mountains then, but to push on at once to
Co&ccedil;a, there to rest and recuperate before undertaking further
exploration. In the meantime <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href=
"#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>he hoped also to obtain more definite
information concerning the mines. As the chief purpose of the
expedition was the discovery of the mines, many of the officers
regarded this change of plan as a mistake, and favored staying where
they were until the new crop should be ripened, then to go directly
into the mountains, but as the general was &ldquo;a stern man and of
few words,&rdquo; none ventured to oppose his resolution.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1884src" href="#xd25e1884" name=
"xd25e1884src">18</a> The province of Co&ccedil;a was the territory of
the Creek Indians, called Ani&prime;-Kusa by the Cherokee, from Kusa,
or Coosa, their ancient capital, while Chiaha was identical with
Chehaw, one of the principal Creek towns on Chattahoochee river.
Cofitachiqui may have been the capital of the Uchee Indians.</p>
<p>The outrageous conduct of the Spaniards had so angered the Indian
queen that she now refused to furnish guides and carriers, whereupon De
Soto made her a prisoner, with the design of compelling her to act as
guide herself, and at the same time to use her as a hostage to command
the obedience of her subjects. Instead, however, of conducting the
Spaniards by the direct trail toward the west, she led them far out of
their course until she finally managed to make her escape, leaving them
to find their way out of the mountains as best they could.</p>
<p>Departing from Cofitachiqui, they turned first toward the north,
passing through several towns subject to the queen, to whom, although a
prisoner, the Indians everywhere showed great respect and obedience,
furnishing whatever assistance the Spaniards compelled her to demand
for their own purposes. In a few days they came to &ldquo;a province
called Chalaque,&rdquo; the territory of the Cherokee Indians, probably
upon the waters of Keowee river, the eastern head-stream of the
Savannah. It is described as the poorest country for corn that they had
yet seen, the inhabitants subsisting on wild roots and herbs and on
game which they killed with bows and arrows. They were naked, lean, and
unwarlike. The country abounded in wild turkeys
(&ldquo;gallinas&rdquo;), which the people gave very freely to the
strangers, one town presenting them with seven hundred. A chief also
gave De Soto two deerskins as a great present.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1894src" href="#xd25e1894" name="xd25e1894src">19</a> Garcilaso,
writing on the authority of an old soldier nearly fifty years
afterward, says that the. &ldquo;Chalaques&rdquo; deserted their towns
on the approach of the white men and fled to the mountains, leaving
behind only old men and women and some who were nearly blind.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1897src" href="#xd25e1897" name=
"xd25e1897src">20</a> Although it was too early for the new crop, the
poverty of the people may have been more apparent than real, due to
their unwillingness to give any part of their stored-up provision to
the unwelcome strangers. As the Spaniards were greatly in need of corn
for themselves and their horses, they made no stay, but hurried on. In
a few days they arrived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href=
"#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>at Guaquili, which is mentioned only
by Ranjel, who does not specify whether it was a town or a
province&mdash;i. e., a tribal territory. It was probably a small town.
Here they were welcomed in a friendly manner, the Indians giving them a
little corn and many wild turkeys, together with some dogs of a
peculiar small species, which were bred for eating purposes and did not
bark.<a class="noteref" id="n25.1src" href="#n25.1" name=
"n25.1src">21</a> They were also supplied with men to help carry the
baggage. The name Guaquili has a Cherokee sound and may be connected
with <i>wa&prime;gul&#301;&prime;</i>, &ldquo;whippoorwill,&rdquo;
<i>uw&acirc;&prime;gi&#699;l&#301;</i>, &ldquo;foam,&rdquo; or
<i>gi&#699;l&#301;</i>, &ldquo;dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Traveling still toward the north, they arrived a day or two later in
the province of Xuala, in which we recognize the territory of the
Suwali, Sara, or Cheraw Indians, in the piedmont region about the head
of Broad river in North Carolina. Garcilaso, who did not see it,
represents it as a rich country, while the Elvas narrative and Biedma
agree that it was a rough, broken country, thinly inhabited and poor in
provision. According to Garcilaso, it was under the rule of the queen
of Cofitachiqui, although a distinct province in itself.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1917src" href="#xd25e1917" name=
"xd25e1917src">22</a> The principal town was beside a small rapid
stream, close under a mountain. The chief received them in friendly
fashion, giving them corn, dogs of the small breed already mentioned,
carrying baskets, and burden bearers. The country roundabout showed
greater indications of gold mines than any they had yet seen.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n25.1">21</a></p>
<p>Here De Soto turned to the west, crossing a very high mountain
range, which appears to have been the Blue ridge, and descending on the
other side to a stream flowing in the opposite direction, which was
probably one of the upper tributaries of the French Broad.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1925src" href="#xd25e1925" name=
"xd25e1925src">23</a> Although it was late in May, they found it very
cold in the mountains.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1928src" href=
"#xd25e1928" name="xd25e1928src">24</a> After several days of such
travel they arrived, about the end of the month, at the town of
Guasili, or Guaxule. The chief and principal men came out some distance
to welcome them, dressed in fine robes of skins, with feather
head-dresses, after the fashion of the country. Before reaching this
point the queen had managed to make her escape, together with three
slaves of the Spaniards, and the last that was heard of her was that
she was on her way back to her own country with one of the runaways as
her husband. What grieved De Soto most in the matter was that she took
with her a small box of pearls, which he had intended to take from her
before releasing her, but had left with her for the present in order
&ldquo;not to discontent her altogether.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1934src" href="#xd25e1934" name="xd25e1934src">25</a></p>
<p>Guaxule is described as a very large town surrounded by a number of
small mountain streams which united to form the large river down which
the Spaniards proceeded after leaving the place.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1942src" href="#xd25e1942" name="xd25e1942src">26</a> Here, as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>elsewhere, the Indians received the white men with
kindness and hospitality&mdash;so much so that the name of Guaxule
became to the army a synonym for good fortune.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1947src" href="#xd25e1947" name="xd25e1947src">27</a> Among other
things they gave the Spaniards 300 dogs for food, although, according
to the Elvas narrative, the Indians themselves did not eat
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1953src" href="#xd25e1953" name=
"xd25e1953src">28</a> The principal officers of the expedition were
lodged in the &ldquo;chief&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; by which we are to
understand the townhouse, which was upon a high hill with a roadway to
the top.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1956src" href="#xd25e1956" name=
"xd25e1956src">29</a> From a close study of the narrative it appears
that this &ldquo;hill&rdquo; was no other than the great Nacoochee
mound, in White county, Georgia, a few miles northwest of the present
Clarkesville.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1960src" href="#xd25e1960"
name="xd25e1960src">30</a> It was within the Cherokee territory, and
the town was probably a settlement of that tribe. From here De Soto
sent runners ahead to notify the chief of Chiaha of his approach, in
order that sufficient corn might be ready on his arrival.</p>
<p>Leaving Guaxule, they proceeded down the river, which we identify
with the Chattahoochee, and in two days arrived at Canasoga, or
Canasagua, a frontier town of the Cherokee. As they neared the town
they were met by the Indians, bearing baskets of
&ldquo;mulberries,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1965src" href=
"#xd25e1965" name="xd25e1965src">31</a> more probably the delicious
service-berry of the southern mountains, which ripens in early summer,
while the mulberry matures later.</p>
<p>From here they continued down the river, which grew constantly
larger, through an uninhabited country which formed the disputed
territory between the Cherokee and the Creeks. About five days after
leaving Canasagua they were met by messengers, who escorted them to
Chiaha, the first town of the province of Co&ccedil;a. De Soto had
crossed the state of Georgia, leaving the Cherokee country behind him,
and was now among the Lower Creeks, in the neighborhood of the present
Columbus, Georgia.<a class="noteref" id="n26.6src" href="#n26.6" name=
"n26.6src">32</a> With his subsequent wanderings after crossing the
Chattahoochee into Alabama and beyond we need not concern ourselves
(8).</p>
<p>While resting at Chiaha De Soto met with a chief who confirmed what
the Spaniards had heard before concerning mines in the province of
Chisca, saying that there was there &ldquo;a melting of copper&rdquo;
and of another metal of about the same color, but softer, and therefore
not so much used.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1978src" href="#xd25e1978"
name="xd25e1978src">33</a> The province was northward from Chiaha,
somewhere in upper Georgia or the adjacent part of Alabama or
Tennessee, through all of which mountain region native copper is found.
The other mineral, which the Spaniards understood to be gold, may have
been iron pyrites, although there is some evidence that the Indians
occasionally found and shaped gold nuggets.<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n26.6">32</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27"
name="pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>Accordingly two soldiers were sent on foot with Indian guides to
find Chisca and learn the truth of the stories. They rejoined the army
some time after the march had been resumed, and reported<span class=
"corr" id="xd25e1988" title="Not in source">,</span> according to the
Elvas chronicler, that their guides had taken them through a country so
poor in corn, so rough, and over so high mountains that it would be
impossible for the army to follow, wherefore, as the way grew long and
lingering, they had turned back after reaching a little poor town where
they saw nothing that was of any profit. They brought back with them a
dressed buffalo skin which the Indians there had given them, the first
ever obtained by white men, and described in the quaint old chronicle
as &ldquo;an ox hide as thin as a calf&rsquo;s skin, and the hair like
a soft wool between the coarse and fine wool of sheep.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1991src" href="#xd25e1991" name=
"xd25e1991src">34</a></p>
<p>Garcilaso&rsquo;s glowing narrative gives a somewhat different
impression. According to this author the scouts returned full of
enthusiasm for the fertility of the country, and reported that the
mines were of a fine species of copper, and had indications also of
gold and silver, while their progress from one town to another had been
a continual series of feastings and Indian hospitalities.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1999src" href="#xd25e1999" name=
"xd25e1999src">35</a> However that may have been, De Soto made no
further effort to reach the Cherokee mines, but continued his course
westward through the Creek country, having spent altogether a month in
the mountain region.</p>
<p>There is no record of any second attempt to penetrate the Cherokee
country for twenty-six years (9). In 1561 the Spaniards took formal
possession of the bay of Santa Elena, now Saint Helena, near Port
Royal, on the coast of South Carolina. The next year the French made an
unsuccessful attempt at settlement at the same place, and in 1566
Menendez made the Spanish occupancy sure by establishing there a fort
which he called San Felipe.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2004src" href=
"#xd25e2004" name="xd25e2004src">36</a> In November of that year
Captain Juan Pardo was sent with a party from the fort to explore the
interior. Accompanied by the chief of &ldquo;Juada&rdquo; (which from
Vandera&rsquo;s narrative we find should be &ldquo;Joara,&rdquo; i. e.,
the Sara Indians already mentioned in the De Soto chronicle), he
proceeded as far as the territory of that tribe, where he built a fort,
but on account of the snow in the mountains did not think it advisable
to go farther, and returned, leaving a sergeant with thirty soldiers to
garrison the post. Soon after his return he received a letter from the
sergeant stating that the chief of Chisca&mdash;the rich mining country
of which De Soto had heard&mdash;was very hostile to the Spaniards, and
that in a recent battle the latter had killed a thousand of his Indians
and burned fifty houses with almost no damage to themselves. Either the
sergeant or his chronicler must have been an unconscionable liar, as it
was asserted that all this was done with only fifteen men. Immediately
afterward, according to the same story, the sergeant marched with
twenty men about a day&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28"
href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>distance in the mountains
against another hostile chief, whom he found in a strongly palisaded
town, which, after a hard fight, he and his men stormed and burned,
killing fifteen hundred Indians without losing a single man themselves.
Under instructions from his superior officer, the sergeant with his
small party then proceeded to explore what lay beyond, and, taking a
road which they were told led to the territory of a great chief, after
four days of hard marching they came to his town, called Chiaha
(Chicha, by mistake in the manuscript translation), the same where De
Soto had rested. It is described at this time as palisaded and strongly
fortified, with a deep river on each side, and defended by over three
thousand fighting men, there being no women or children among them. It
is possible that in view of their former experience with the Spaniards,
the Indians had sent their families away from the town, while at the
same time they may have summoned warriors from the neighboring Creek
towns in order to be prepared for any emergency. However, as before,
they received the white men with the greatest kindness, and the
Spaniards continued for twelve days through the territories of the same
tribe until they arrived at the principal town (Kusa?), where, by the
invitation of the chief, they built a small fort and awaited the coming
of Pardo, who was expected to follow with a larger force from Santa
Elena, as he did in the summer of 1567, being met on his arrival with
every show of hospitality from the Creek chiefs. This second fort was
said to be one hundred and forty leagues distant from that in the Sara
country, which latter was called one hundred and twenty leagues from
Santa Elena.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2012src" href="#xd25e2012"
name="xd25e2012src">37</a></p>
<p>In the summer of 1567, according to previous agreement, Captain
Pardo left the fort at Santa Elena with a small detachment of troops,
and after a week&rsquo;s travel, sleeping each night at a different
Indian town, arrived at &ldquo;Canos, which the Indians call Canosi,
and by another name, Cofeta&ccedil;que&rdquo; (the Cofitachiqui of the
De Soto chronicle), which is described as situated in a favorable
location for a large city, fifty leagues from Santa Elena, to which the
easiest road was by a river (the Savannah) which flowed by the town, or
by another which they had passed ten leagues farther back. Proceeding,
they passed Jagaya, Gueza, and Arauchi, and arrived at Otariyatiqui, or
Otari, in which we have perhaps the Cherokee
<i>&acirc;&prime;t&#259;r&#301;</i> or
<i>&acirc;&prime;t&#259;l&#301;</i>, &ldquo;mountain&rdquo;. It may
have been a frontier Cherokee settlement, and, according to the old
chronicler, its chief and language ruled much good country. From here a
trail went northward to Guatari, Sauxpa, and Usi, i. e., the Wateree,
Waxhaw (or Sissipahaw?), and Ushery or Catawba.</p>
<p>Leaving Otariyatiqui, they went on to Quinahaqui, and then, turning
to the left, to Issa, where they found mines of crystal (mica?). They
came next to Aguaquiri (the Guaquili of the De Soto chronicle), and
then to Joara, &ldquo;near to the mountain, where Juan Pardo arrived
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>with his sergeant on his first trip.&rdquo; This,
as has been noted, was the Xuala of the De Soto chronicle, the
territory of the Sara Indians, in the foothills of the Blue ridge,
southeast from the present Asheville, North Carolina. Vandera makes it
one hundred leagues from Santa Elena, while Martinez, already quoted,
makes the distance one hundred and twenty leagues. The difference is
not important, as both statements were only estimates. From there they
followed &ldquo;along the mountains&rdquo; to Tocax (Toxaway?), Cauchi
(Nacoochee?), and Tanasqui&mdash;apparently Cherokee towns, although
the forms can not be identified&mdash;and after resting three days at
the last-named place went on &ldquo;to Solameco, otherwise called
Chiaha,&rdquo; where the sergeant met them. The combined forces
afterward went on, through Cossa (Kusa), Tasquiqui (Taskigi), and other
Creek towns, as far as Tascaluza, in the Alabama country, and returned
thence to Santa Elena, having apparently met with a friendly reception
everywhere along the route. From Cofitachiqui to Tascaluza they went
over about the same road traversed by De Soto in 1540.<a class=

<p>We come now to a great gap of nearly a century. Shea has a notice of
a Spanish mission founded among the Cherokee in 1643 and still
flourishing when visited by an English traveler ten years
later,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2032src" href="#xd25e2032" name=
"xd25e2032src">39</a> but as his information is derived entirely from
the fraudulent work of Davies, and as no such mission is mentioned by
Barcia in any of these years, we may regard the story as spurious (10).
The first mission work in the tribe appears to have been that of
Priber, almost a hundred years later. Long before the end of the
sixteenth century, however, the existence of mines of gold and other
metals in the Cherokee country was a matter of common knowledge among
the Spaniards at St. Augustine and Santa Elena, and more than one
expedition had been fitted out to explore the interior.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2035src" href="#xd25e2035" name=
"xd25e2035src">40</a> Numerous traces of ancient mining operations,
with remains of old shafts and fortifications, evidently of European
origin, show that these discoveries were followed up, although the
policy of Spain concealed the fact from the outside world. How much
permanent impression this early Spanish intercourse made on the
Cherokee it is impossible to estimate, but it must have been
considerable (11).</p>

Period</span>&mdash;1654&ndash;1784</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was not until 1654 that the English first came into
contact with the Cherokee, called in the records of the period
Rechahecrians, a corruption of Rickahockan, apparently the name by
which they were known to the Powhatan tribes. In that year the Virginia
colony, which had only recently concluded a long and exterminating war
with the Powhatan, was thrown into alarm by the news that a great body
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>six or seven hundred Rechahecrian Indians&mdash;by
which is probably meant that number of warriors&mdash;from the
mountains had invaded the lower country and established themselves at
the falls of James river, where now is the city of Richmond. The
assembly at once passed resolutions &ldquo;that these new come Indians
be in no sort suffered to seat themselves there, or any place near us,
it having cost so much blood to expel and extirpate those perfidious
and treacherous Indians which were there formerly.&rdquo; It was
therefore ordered that a force of at least 100 white men be at once
sent against them, to be joined by the warriors of all the neighboring
subject tribes, according to treaty obligation. The Pamunkey chief,
with a hundred of his men, responded to the summons, and the combined
force marched against the invaders. The result was a bloody battle,
with disastrous outcome to the Virginians, the Pamunkey chief with most
of his men being killed, while the whites were forced to make such
terms of peace with the Rechahecrians that the assembly cashiered the
commander of the expedition and compelled him to pay the whole cost of
the treaty from his own estate.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2047src"
href="#xd25e2047" name="xd25e2047src">41</a> Owing to the imperfection
of the Virginia records we have no means of knowing the causes of the
sudden invasion or how long the invaders retained their position at the
falls. In all probability it was only the last of a long series of
otherwise unrecorded irruptions by the mountaineers on the more
peaceful dwellers in the lowlands. From a remark in Lederer it is
probable that the Cherokee were assisted also by some of the piedmont
tribes hostile to the Powhatan. The Peaks of Otter, near which the
Cherokee claim to have once lived, as has been already noted, are only
about one hundred miles in a straight line from Richmond, while the
burial mound and town site near Charlottesville, mentioned by
Jefferson, are but half that distance.</p>
<p>In 1655 a Virginia expedition sent out from the falls of James river
(Richmond) crossed over the mountains to the large streams flowing into
the Mississippi. No details are given and the route is uncertain, but
whether or not they met Indians, they must have passed through Cherokee
territory.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2055src" href="#xd25e2055" name=
"xd25e2055src">42</a></p>
<p>In 1670 the German traveler, John Lederer, went from the falls of
James river to the Catawba country in South Carolina, following for
most of the distance the path used by the Virginia traders, who already
had regular dealings with the southern tribes, including probably the
Cherokee. He speaks in several places of the Rickahockan, which seems
to be a more correct form than Rechahecrian, and his narrative and the
accompanying map put them in the mountains of North Carolina, back of
the Catawba and the Sara and southward from the head of Roanoke river.
They were apparently on hostile terms with the tribes to the eastward,
and while the traveler was stopping at an Indian <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>village
on Dan river, about the present Clarksville, Virginia, a delegation of
Rickahockan, which had come on tribal business, was barbarously
murdered at a dance prepared on the night of their arrival by their
treacherous hosts. On reaching the Catawba country he heard of white
men to the southward, and incidentally mentions that the neighboring
mountains were called the Suala mountains by the Spaniards.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2065src" href="#xd25e2065" name=
"xd25e2065src">43</a> In the next year, 1671, a party from Virginia
under Thomas Batts explored the northern branch of Roanoke river and
crossed over the Blue ridge to the headwaters of New river, where they
found traces of occupancy, but no Indians. By this time all the tribes
of this section, east of the mountains, were in possession of
firearms.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2071src" href="#xd25e2071" name=
"xd25e2071src">44</a></p>
<p>The first permanent English settlement in South Carolina was
established in 1670. In 1690 James Moore, secretary of the colony, made
an exploring expedition into the mountains and reached a point at
which, according to his Indian guides, he was within twenty miles of
where the Spaniards were engaged in mining and smelting with bellows
and furnaces, but on account of some misunderstanding he returned
without visiting the place, although he procured specimens of ores,
which he sent to England for assay.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2076src"
href="#xd25e2076" name="xd25e2076src">45</a> It may have been in the
neighborhood of the present Lincolnton, North Carolina, where a dam of
cut stone and other remains of former civilized occupancy have recently
been discovered (11). In this year, also, Cornelius Dougherty, an
Irishman from Virginia, established himself as the first trader among
the Cherokee, with whom he spent the rest of his life.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2082src" href="#xd25e2082" name=
"xd25e2082src">46</a> Some of his descendants still occupy honored
positions in the tribe.</p>
<p>Among the manuscript archives of South Carolina there was said to
be, some fifty years ago, a treaty or agreement made with the
government of that colony by the Cherokee in 1684, and signed with the
hieroglyphics of eight chiefs of the lower towns, viz, Corani, the
Raven (K&acirc;&prime;lan&ucirc;); Sinnawa, the Hawk
(Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;); Nellawgitehi, Gorhaleke, and Owasta, all of
Toxawa; and Canacaught, the great Conjuror, Gohoma, and Caunasaita, of
Keowa. If still in existence, this is probably the oldest Cherokee
treaty on record.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2087src" href="#xd25e2087"
name="xd25e2087src">47</a></p>
<p>What seems to be the next mention of the Cherokee in the South
Carolina records occurs in 1691, when we find an inquiry ordered in
regard to a report that some of the colonists &ldquo;have, without any
proclamation of war, fallen upon and murdered&rdquo; several of that
tribe.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2092src" href="#xd25e2092" name=
"xd25e2092src">48</a></p>
<p>In 1693 some Cherokee chiefs went to Charleston with presents for
the governor and offers of friendship, to ask the protection of South
Carolina against their enemies, the Esaw (Catawba), Savanna (Shawano),
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>and Congaree, all of that colony, who had made war
upon them and sold a number of their tribesmen into slavery. They were
told that their kinsmen could not now be recovered, but that the
English desired friendship with their tribe, and that the Government
would see that there would be no future ground for such
complaint.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2102src" href="#xd25e2102" name=
"xd25e2102src">49</a> The promise was apparently not kept, for in 1705
we find a bitter accusation brought against Governor Moore, of South
Carolina, that he had granted commissions to a number of persons
&ldquo;to set upon, assault, kill, destroy, and take captive as many
Indians as they possible [<i>sic</i>] could,&rdquo; the prisoners being
sold into slavery for his and their private profit. By this course, it
was asserted, he had &ldquo;already almost utterly ruined the trade for
skins and furs, whereby we held our chief correspondence with England,
and turned it into a trade of Indians or slave making, whereby the
Indians to the south and west of us are already involved in blood and
confusion.&rdquo; The arraignment concludes with a warning that such
conditions would in all probability draw down upon the colony an Indian
war with all its dreadful consequences.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2111src" href="#xd25e2111" name="xd25e2111src">50</a> In view of
what happened a few years later this reads like a prophecy.</p>
<p>About the year 1700 the first guns were introduced among the
Cherokee, the event being fixed traditionally as having occurred in the
girlhood of an old woman of the tribe who died about 1775.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2119src" href="#xd25e2119" name=
"xd25e2119src">51</a> In 1708 we find them described as a numerous
people, living in the mountains northwest from the Charleston
settlements and having sixty towns, but of small importance in the
Indian trade, being &ldquo;but ordinary hunters and less
warriors.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2122src" href="#xd25e2122"
name="xd25e2122src">52</a></p>
<p>In the war with the Tuscarora in 1711&ndash;1713, which resulted in
the expulsion of that tribe from North Carolina, more than a thousand
southern Indians reenforced the South Carolina volunteers, among them
being over two hundred Cherokee, hereditary enemies of the Tuscarora.
Although these Indian allies did their work well in the actual
encounters, their assistance was of doubtful advantage, as they helped
themselves freely to whatever they wanted along the way, so that the
settlers had reason to fear them almost as much as the hostile
Tuscarora. After torturing a large number of their prisoners in the
usual savage fashion, they returned with the remainder, whom they
afterward sold as slaves to South Carolina.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2127src" href="#xd25e2127" name="xd25e2127src">53</a></p>
<p>Having wiped out old scores with the Tuscarora, the late allies of
the English proceeded to discuss their own grievances, which, as we
have seen, were sufficiently galling. The result was a combination
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>against the whites, embracing all the tribes from
Cape Fear to the Chattahoochee, including the Cherokee, who thus for
the first time raised their hand against the English. The war opened
with a terrible massacre by the Yamassee in April, 1715, followed by
assaults along the whole frontier, until for a time it was seriously
feared that the colony of South Carolina would be wiped out of
existence. In a contest between savagery and civilization, however, the
final result is inevitable. The settlers at last rallied their whole
force under Governor Craven and administered such a crushing blow to
the Yamassee that the remnant abandoned their country and took refuge
with the Spaniards in Florida or among the Lower Creeks. The English
then made short work with the smaller tribes along the coast, while
those in the interior were soon glad to sue for peace.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2134src" href="#xd25e2134" name=
"xd25e2134src">54</a></p>
<p>A number of Cherokee chiefs having come down to Charleston in
company with a trader to express their desire for peace, a force of
several hundred white troops and a number of negroes under Colonel
Maurice Moore went up the Savannah in the winter of 1715&ndash;16 and
made headquarters among the Lower Cherokee, where they were met by the
chiefs of the Lower and some of the western towns, who reaffirmed their
desire for a lasting peace with the English, but refused to fight
against the Yamassee, although willing to proceed against some other
tribes. They laid the blame for most of the trouble upon the traders,
who &ldquo;had been very abuseful to them of late.&rdquo; A detachment
under Colonel George Chicken, sent to the Upper Cherokee, penetrated to
&ldquo;Quoneashee&rdquo; (Tlanusi&prime;y&#301;, on Hiwassee, about the
present Murphy) where they found the chiefs more defiant, resolved to
continue the war against the Creeks, with whom the English were then
trying to make peace, and demanding large supplies of guns and
ammunition, saying that if they made a peace with the other tribes they
would have no means of getting slaves with which to buy ammunition for
themselves. At this time they claimed 2,370 warriors, of whom half were
believed to have guns. As the strength of the whole Nation was much
greater, this estimate may have been for the Upper and Middle Cherokee
only. After &ldquo;abundance of persuading&rdquo; by the officers, they
finally &ldquo;told us they would trust us once again,&rdquo; and an
arrangement was made to furnish them two hundred guns with a supply of
ammunition, together with fifty white soldiers, to assist them against
the tribes with which the English were still at war. In March, 1716,
this force was increased by one hundred men. The detachment under
Colonel Chicken returned by way of the towns on the upper part of the
Little Tennessee, thus penetrating the heart of the Cherokee
country.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2143src" href="#xd25e2143" name=

<p>Steps were now taken to secure peace by inaugurating a satisfactory
trade system, for which purpose a large quantity of suitable goods was
purchased at the public expense of South Carolina, and a
correspondingly large party was equipped for the initial trip.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2149src" href="#xd25e2149" name=
"xd25e2149src">56</a> In 1721, in order still more to systematize
Indian affairs, Governor Nicholson of South Carolina invited the chiefs
of the Cherokee to a conference, at which thirty-seven towns were
represented. A treaty was made by which trading methods were regulated,
a boundary line between their territory and the English settlements was
agreed upon, and an agent was appointed to superintend their affairs.
At the governor&rsquo;s suggestion, one chief, called
Wrosetasatow(?)<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2155src" href="#xd25e2155"
name="xd25e2155src">57</a> was formally commissioned as supreme head of
the Nation, with authority to punish all offenses, including murder,
and to represent all Cherokee claims to the colonial government. Thus
were the Cherokee reduced from their former condition of a free people,
ranging where their pleasure led, to that of dependent vassals with
bounds fixed by a colonial governor. The negotiations were accompanied
by a cession of land, the first in the history of the tribe. In little
more than a century thereafter they had signed away their whole
original territory.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2161src" href=
"#xd25e2161" name="xd25e2161src">58</a></p>
<p>The document of 1716 already quoted puts the strength of the
Cherokee at that time at 2,370 warriors, but in this estimate the Lower
Cherokee seem not to have been included. In 1715, according to a trade
census compiled by Governor Johnson of South Carolina, the tribe had
thirty towns, with 4,000 warriors and a total population of
11,210.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2169src" href="#xd25e2169" name=
"xd25e2169src">59</a> Another census in 1721 gives them fifty-three
towns with 3,510 warriors and a total of 10,379,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2172src" href="#xd25e2172" name="xd25e2172src">60</a> while the
report of the board of trade for the same year gives them 3,800
warriors,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2175src" href="#xd25e2175" name=
"xd25e2175src">61</a> equivalent, by the same proportion, to nearly
12,000 total. Adair, a good authority on such matters, estimates, about
the year 1735, when the country was better known, that they had
&ldquo;sixty-four towns and villages, populous and full of
children,&rdquo; with more than 6,000 fighting men,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e2181src" href="#xd25e2181" name="xd25e2181src">62</a>
equivalent on the same basis of computation to between 16,000 and
17,000 souls. From what we know of them in later times, it is probable
that this last estimate is very nearly correct.</p>
<p>By this time the colonial government had become alarmed at the
advance of the French, who had made their first permanent establishment
in the Gulf states at Biloxi bay, Mississippi, in 1699, and in 1714 had
built Fort Toulouse, known to the English as &ldquo;the fort at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>the Alabamas,&rdquo; on Coosa river, a few miles
above the present Montgomery, Alabama. From this central vantage point
they had rapidly extended their influence among all the neighboring
tribes until in 1721 it was estimated that 3,400 warriors who had
formerly traded with Carolina had been &ldquo;entirely debauched to the
French interest,&rdquo; while 2,000 more were wavering, and only the
Cherokee could still be considered friendly to the English.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2188src" href="#xd25e2188" name=
"xd25e2188src">63</a> From this time until the final withdrawal of the
French in 1763 the explanation of our Indian wars is to be found in the
struggle between the two nations for territorial and commercial
supremacy, the Indian being simply the cat&rsquo;s-paw of one or the
other. For reasons of their own, the Chickasaw, whose territory lay
within the recognized limits of Louisiana, soon became the
uncompromising enemies of the French, and as their position enabled
them in a measure to control the approach from the Mississippi, the
Carolina government saw to it that they were kept well supplied with
guns and ammunition. British traders were in all their towns, and on
one occasion a French force, advancing against a Chickasaw palisaded
village, found it garrisoned by Englishmen flying the British
flag.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2194src" href="#xd25e2194" name=
"xd25e2194src">64</a> The Cherokee, although nominally allies of the
English, were strongly disposed to favor the French, and it required
every effort of the Carolina government to hold them to their
allegiance.</p>
<p>In 1730, to further fix the Cherokee in the English interest, Sir
Alexander Cuming was dispatched on a secret mission to that tribe,
which was again smarting under grievances and almost ready to join with
the Creeks in an alliance with the French. Proceeding to the ancient
town of Nequassee (N&#301;kw&#259;s&#301;&prime;, at the present
Franklin, North Carolina), he so impressed the chiefs by his bold
bearing that they conceded without question all his demands, submitting
themselves and their people for the second time to the English dominion
and designating Moytoy,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2199src" href=
"#xd25e2199" name="xd25e2199src">65</a> of Tellico, to act as their
&ldquo;emperor&rdquo; and to represent the Nation in all transactions
with the whites. Seven chiefs were selected to visit England, where, in
the palace at Whitehall, they solemnly renewed the treaty,
acknowledging the sovereignty of England and binding themselves to have
no trade or alliance with any other nation, not to allow any other
white people to settle among them, and to deliver up any fugitive
slaves who might seek refuge with them. To confirm their words they
delivered a &ldquo;crown&rdquo;, five eagle-tails, and four scalps,
which they had brought with them. In return they received the usual
glittering promises of love and perpetual friendship, together with a
substantial quantity of guns, ammunition, and red paint. The treaty
being concluded in September, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=
"#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>they took ship for Carolina, where
they arrived, as we are told by the governor, &ldquo;in good health and
mightily well satisfied with His Majesty&rsquo;s bounty to
them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2207src" href="#xd25e2207"
name="xd25e2207src">66</a></p>
<p>In the next year some action was taken to use the Cherokee and
Catawba to subdue the refractory remnant of the Tuscarora in North
Carolina, but when it was found that this was liable to bring down the
wrath of the Iroquois upon the Carolina settlements, more peaceable
methods were used instead.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2224src" href=
"#xd25e2224" name="xd25e2224src">67</a></p>
<p>In 1738 or 1739 the smallpox, brought to Carolina by slave ships,
broke out among the Cherokee with such terrible effect that, according
to Adair, nearly half the tribe was swept away within a year. The awful
mortality was due largely to the fact that as it was a new and strange
disease to the Indians they had no proper remedies against it, and
therefore resorted to the universal Indian panacea for
&ldquo;strong&rdquo; sickness of almost any kind, viz, cold plunge
baths in the running stream, the worst treatment that could possibly be
devised. As the pestilence spread unchecked from town to town, despair
fell upon the nation. The priests, believing the visitation a penalty
for violation of the ancient ordinances, threw away their sacred
paraphernalia as things which had lost their protecting power. Hundreds
of the warriors committed suicide on beholding their frightful
disfigurement. &ldquo;Some shot themselves, others cut their throats,
some stabbed themselves with knives and others with sharp-pointed
canes; many threw themselves with sullen madness into the fire and
there slowly expired, as if they had been utterly divested of the
native power of feeling pain.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2232src" href="#xd25e2232" name="xd25e2232src">68</a> Another
authority estimates their loss at a thousand warriors, partly from
smallpox and partly from rum brought in by the traders.<a class=
"noteref" id="n36.4src" href="#n36.4" name="n36.4src">69</a></p>
<p>About the year 1740 a trading path for horsemen was marked out by
the Cherokee from the new settlement of Augusta, in Georgia, to their
towns on the headwaters of Savannah river and thence on to the west.
This road, which went up the south side of the river, soon became much
frequented.<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n36.4">69</a> Previous to
this time most, of the trading goods had been transported on the backs
of Indians. In the same year a party of Cherokee under the war chief
K&acirc;&prime;lan&ucirc;. &ldquo;The Raven,&rdquo; took part in
Oglethorpe&rsquo;s expedition against the Spaniards of Saint
Augustine.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2246src" href="#xd25e2246" name=
"xd25e2246src">70</a></p>
<p>In 1736 Christian Priber, said to be a Jesuit acting in the French
interest, had come among the Cherokee, and, by the facility with which
he learned the language and adapted himself to the native dress and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>mode of life, had quickly acquired a leading
influence among them. He drew up for their adoption a scheme of
government modeled after the European plan, with the capital at Great
Tellico, in Tennessee, the principal medicine man as emperor, and
himself as the emperor&rsquo;s secretary. Under this title he
corresponded with the South Carolina government until it began to be
feared that he would ultimately win over the whole tribe to the French
side. A commissioner was sent to arrest him, but the Cherokee refused
to give him up, and the deputy was obliged to return under safe-conduct
of an escort furnished by Priber. Five years after the inauguration of
his work, however, he was seized by some English traders while on his
way to Fort Toulouse, and brought as a prisoner to Frederica, in
Georgia, where he soon afterward died while under confinement. Although
his enemies had represented him as a monster, inciting the Indians to
the grossest immoralities, he proved to be a gentleman of polished
address, extensive learning, and rare courage, as was shown later on
the occasion of an explosion in the barracks magazine. Besides Greek,
Latin, French, German, Spanish, and fluent English, he spoke also the
Cherokee, and among his papers which were seized was found a manuscript
dictionary of the language, which he had prepared for
publication&mdash;the first, and even yet, perhaps, the most important
study of the language ever made. Says Adair: &ldquo;As he was learned
and possessed of a very sagacious penetrating judgment, and had every
qualification that was requisite for his bold and difficult enterprise,
it was not to be doubted that, as he wrote a Cheerake dictionary,
designed to be published at Paris, he likewise set down a great deal
that would have been very acceptable to the curious and serviceable to
the representatives of South Carolina and Georgia, which may be readily
found in Frederica if the manuscripts have had the good fortune to
escape the despoiling hands of military power.&rdquo; He claimed to be
a Jesuit, acting under orders of his superior, to introduce habits of
steady industry, civilized arts, and a regular form of government among
the southern tribes, with a view to the ultimate founding of an
independent Indian state. From all that can be gathered of him, even
though it comes from his enemies, there can be little doubt that he was
a worthy member of that illustrious order whose name has been a synonym
for scholarship, devotion, and courage from the days of Jogues and
Marquette down to De Smet and Mengarini.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2256src" href="#xd25e2256" name="xd25e2256src">71</a></p>
<p>Up to this time no civilizing or mission work had been undertaken by
either of the Carolina governments among any of the tribes within their
borders. As one writer of the period quaintly puts it, &ldquo;The
gospel spirit is not yet so gloriously arisen as to seek them more than
theirs,&rdquo; while another in stronger terms affirms, &ldquo;To the
shame of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>the Christian name, no pains have ever been taken
to convert them to Christianity; on the contrary, their morals are
perverted and corrupted by the sad example they daily have of its
depraved professors residing in their towns.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e2266src" href="#xd25e2266" name="xd25e2266src">72</a> Readers
of Lawson and other narratives of the period will feel the force of the
rebuke.</p>
<p>Throughout the eighteenth century the Cherokee were engaged in
chronic warfare with their Indian neighbors. As these quarrels
concerned the whites but little, however momentous they may have been
to the principals, we have but few details. The war with the Tuscarora
continued until the outbreak of the latter tribe against Carolina in
1711 gave opportunity to the Cherokee to cooperate in striking the blow
which drove the Tuscarora from their ancient homes to seek refuge in
the north. The Cherokee then turned their attention to the Shawano on
the Cumberland, and with the aid of the Chickasaw finally expelled them
from that region about the year 1715. Inroads upon the Catawba were
probably kept up until the latter had become so far reduced by war and
disease as to be mere dependent pensioners upon the whites. The former
friendship with the Chickasaw was at last broken through the
overbearing conduct of the Cherokee, and a war followed of which we
find incidental notice in 1757,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2274src"
href="#xd25e2274" name="xd25e2274src">73</a> and which terminated in a
decisive victory for the Chickasaw about 1768. The bitter war with the
Iroquois of the far north continued, in spite of all the efforts of the
colonial governments, until a formal treaty of peace was brought about
by the efforts of Sir William Johnson (12) in the same year.</p>
<p>The hereditary war with the Creeks for possession of upper Georgia
continued, with brief intervals of peace, or even alliance, until the
United States finally interfered as mediator between the rival
claimants. In 1718 we find notice of a large Cherokee war party moving
against the Creek town of Coweta, on the lower Chattahoochee, but
dispersing on learning of the presence there of some French and Spanish
officers, as well as some English traders, all bent on arranging an
alliance with the Creeks. The Creeks themselves had declared their
willingness to be at peace with the English, while still determined to
keep the bloody hatchet uplifted against the Cherokee.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2280src" href="#xd25e2280" name=
"xd25e2280src">74</a> The most important incident of the struggle
between the two tribes was probably the battle of Tali&prime;wa about
the year 1755.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2283src" href="#xd25e2283"
name="xd25e2283src">75</a></p>
<p>By this time the weaker coast tribes had become practically extinct,
and the more powerful tribes of the interior were beginning to take the
alarm, as they saw the restless borderers pushing every year farther
into the Indian country. As early as 1748 Dr Thomas Walker, with a
company of hunters and woodsmen from Virginia, crossed the mountains
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>to the southwest, discovering and naming the
celebrated Cumberland gap and passing on to the headwaters of
Cumberland river. Two years later he made a second exploration and
penetrated to Kentucky river, but on account of the Indian troubles no
permanent settlement was then attempted.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2290src" href="#xd25e2290" name="xd25e2290src">76</a> This
invasion of their territory awakened a natural resentment of the native
owners, and we find proof also in the Virginia records that the
irresponsible borderers seldom let pass an opportunity to kill and
plunder any stray Indian found in their neighborhood.</p>
<p>In 1755 the Cherokee were officially reported to number 2,590
warriors, as against probably twice that number previous to the great
smallpox epidemic sixteen years before. Their neighbors and ancient
enemies, the Catawba, had dwindled to 240 men.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2298src" href="#xd25e2298" name="xd25e2298src">77</a></p>
<p>Although war was not formally declared by England until 1756,
hostilities in the seven year&rsquo;s struggle between France and
England, commonly known in America as the &ldquo;French and Indian
war,&rdquo; began in April, 1754, when the French seized a small post
which the English had begun at the present site of Pittsburg, and which
was afterward finished by the French under the name of Fort Du Quesne.
Strenuous efforts were made by the English to secure the Cherokee to
their interest against the French and their Indian allies, and treaties
were negotiated by which they promised assistance.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e2306src" href="#xd25e2306" name="xd25e2306src">78</a> As these
treaties, however, carried the usual cessions of territory, and
stipulated for the building of several forts in the heart of the
Cherokee country, it is to be feared that the Indians were not duly
impressed by the disinterested character of the proceeding. Their
preference for the French was but thinly veiled, and only immediate
policy prevented them from throwing their whole force into the scale on
that side. The reasons for this preference are given by Timberlake, the
young Virginian officer who visited the tribe on an embassy of
conciliation a few years later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I found the nation much attached to the French, who
have the prudence, by familiar politeness&mdash;which costs but little
and often does a great deal&mdash;and conforming themselves to their
ways and temper, to conciliate the inclinations of almost all the
Indians they are acquainted with, while the pride of our officers often
disgusts them. Nay, they did not scruple to own to me that it was the
trade alone that induced them to make peace with us, and not any
preference to the French, whom they loved a great deal
better&#8202;&hellip;. The English are now so nigh, and encroached
daily so far upon them, that they not only felt the bad effects of it
in their hunting grounds, which were spoiled, but had all the reason in
the world to apprehend being swallowed up by so potent neighbors or
driven from the country inhabited by their fathers, in which they were
born and brought up, in fine, their native soil, for which all men have
a particular tenderness and affection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span></p>
<p>He adds that only dire necessity had induced them to make peace with
the English in 1761.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2316src" href=
"#xd25e2316" name="xd25e2316src">79</a></p>
<p>In accordance with the treaty stipulations Fort Prince George was
built in 1756 adjoining the important Cherokee town of Keowee, on the
headwaters of the Savannah, and Fort Loudon near the junction of
Tellico river with the Little Tennessee, in the center of the Cherokee
towns beyond the mountains.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2321src" href=
"#xd25e2321" name="xd25e2321src">80</a> By special arrangement with the
influential chief, Ata-kullakulla
(&#258;t&#259;&prime;-g&ucirc;l&prime;&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;),<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e2324src" href="#xd25e2324" name="xd25e2324src">81</a> Fort
Dobbs was also built in the same year about 20 miles west of the
present Salisbury, North Carolina.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2330src"
href="#xd25e2330" name="xd25e2330src">82</a></p>
<p>The Cherokee had agreed to furnish four hundred warriors to
cooperate against the French in the north, but before Fort Loudon had
been completed it was very evident that they had repented of their
promise, as their great council at Echota ordered the work stopped and
the garrison on the way to turn back, plainly telling the officer in
charge that they did not want so many white people among them.
Ata-kullakulla, hitherto supposed to be one of the stanchest friends of
the English, was now one of the most determined in the opposition. It
was in evidence also that they were in constant communication with the
French. By much tact and argument their objections were at last
overcome for a time, and they very unwillingly set about raising the
promised force of warriors. Major Andrew Lewis, who superintended the
building of the fort, became convinced that the Cherokee were really
friendly to the French, and that all their professions of friendship
and assistance were &ldquo;only to put a gloss on their knavery.&rdquo;
The fort was finally completed, and, on his suggestion, was garrisoned
with a strong force of two hundred men under Captain
Demer&eacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2335src" href="#xd25e2335"
name="xd25e2335src">83</a> There was strong ground for believing that
some depredations committed about this time on the heads of Catawba and
Broad rivers, in North Carolina, were the joint work of Cherokee and
northern Indians.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2341src" href="#xd25e2341"
name="xd25e2341src">84</a> Notwithstanding all this, a considerable
body of Cherokee joined the British forces on the Virginia
frontier.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2347src" href="#xd25e2347" name=
"xd25e2347src">85</a></p>
<p>Fort Du Quesne was taken by the American provincials under
Washington, November 25, 1758. Quebec was taken September 13, 1759, and
by the final treaty of peace in 1763 the war ended with the transfer of
Canada and the Ohio valley to the crown of England. Louisiana had
already been ceded by France to Spain.</p>
<p>Although France was thus eliminated from the Indian problem, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>Indians themselves were not ready to accept the
settlement. In the north the confederated tribes under Pontiac
continued to war on their own account until 1765. In the South the very
Cherokee who had acted as allies of the British against Fort Du Quesne,
and had voluntarily offered to guard the frontier south of the Potomac,
returned to rouse their tribe to resistance.</p>
<p>The immediate exciting cause of the trouble was an unfortunate
expedition undertaken against the hostile Shawano in February, 1756, by
Major Andrew Lewis (the same who had built Fort Loudon) with some two
hundred Virginia troops assisted by about one hundred Cherokee. After
six weeks of fruitless tramping through the woods, with the ground
covered with snow and the streams so swollen by rains that they lost
their provisions and ammunition in crossing, they were obliged to
return to the settlements in a starving condition, having killed their
horses on the way. The Indian contingent had from the first been
disgusted at the contempt and neglect experienced from those whom they
had come to assist. The Tuscarora and others had already gone home, and
the Cherokee now started to return on foot to their own country.
Finding some horses running loose on the range, they appropriated them,
on the theory that as they had lost their own animals, to say nothing
of having risked their lives, in the service of the colonists, it was
only a fair exchange. The frontiersmen took another view of the
question however, attacked the returning Cherokee, and killed a number
of them, variously stated at from twelve to forty, including several of
their prominent men. According to Adair they also scalped and mutilated
the bodies in the savage fashion to which they had become accustomed in
the border wars, and brought the scalps into the settlements, where
they were represented as those of French Indians and sold at the
regular price then established by law. The young warriors at once
prepared to take revenge, but were restrained by the chiefs until
satisfaction could be demanded in the ordinary way, according to the
treaties arranged with the colonial governments. Application was made
in turn to Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, but without
success. While the women were still wailing night and morning for their
slain kindred, and the Creeks were taunting the warriors for their
cowardice in thus quietly submitting to the injury, some lawless
officers of Fort Prince George committed an unpardonable outrage at the
neighboring Indian town while most of the men were away
hunting.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2358src" href="#xd25e2358" name=
"xd25e2358src">86</a> The warriors could no longer be restrained. Soon
there was news of attacks upon the back settlements of Carolina, while
on the other side of the mountains two soldiers of the Fort Loudon
garrison were killed. War seemed at hand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p>At this juncture, in November, 1758, a party of influential chiefs,
having first ordered back a war party just about to set out from the
western towns against the Carolina settlements, came down to Charleston
and succeeded in arranging the difficulty upon a friendly basis. The
assembly had officially declared peace with the Cherokee, when, in May
of 1759, Governor Lyttleton unexpectedly came forward with a demand for
the surrender for execution of every Indian who had killed a white man
in the recent skirmishes, among these being the chiefs of Citico and
Tellico. At the same time the commander at Fort Loudon, forgetful of
the fact that he had but a small garrison in the midst of several
thousands of restless savages, made a demand for twenty-four other
chiefs whom he suspected of unfriendly action. To compel their
surrender orders were given to stop all trading supplies intended for
the upper Cherokee.</p>
<p>This roused the whole Nation, and a delegation representing every
town came down to Charleston, protesting the desire of the Indians for
peace and friendship, but declaring their inability to surrender their
own chiefs. The governor replied by declaring war in November, 1759, at
once calling out troops and sending messengers to secure the aid of all
the surrounding tribes against the Cherokee. In the meantime a second
delegation of thirty-two of the most prominent men, led by the young
war chief Oconostota, (&Acirc;g&#259;n-st&acirc;ta),<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e2370src" href="#xd25e2370" name="xd25e2370src">87</a> arrived
to make a further effort for peace, but the governor, refusing to
listen to them, seized the whole party and confined them as prisoners
at Fort Prince George, in a room large enough for only six soldiers,
while at the same time he set fourteen hundred troops in motion to
invade the Cherokee country. On further representation by
Ata-kullakulla
(&#258;t&#259;&prime;-g&ucirc;l&prime;&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;),
the civil chief of the Nation and well known as a friend of the
English, the governor released Oconostota and two others after
compelling some half dozen of the delegation to sign a paper by which
they pretended to agree for their tribe to kill or seize any Frenchmen
entering their country, and consented to the imprisonment of the party
until all the warriors demanded had been surrendered for execution or
otherwise. At this stage of affairs the smallpox broke out in the
Cherokee towns, rendering a further stay in their neighborhood unsafe,
and thinking the whole matter now settled on his own basis, Lyttleton
returned to Charleston.</p>
<p>The event soon proved how little he knew of Indian temper.
Oconostota at once laid siege to Fort Prince George, completely cutting
off communication at a time when, as it was now winter, no help could
well be expected from below. In February, 1760, after having kept the
fort thus closely invested for some weeks, he sent word one day by an
Indian woman that he wished to speak to the commander, Lieutenant
Coytmore. As the lieutenant stepped out from the stockade <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>to see
what was wanted, Oconostota, standing on the opposite side of the
river, swung a bridle above his head as a signal to his warriors
concealed in the bushes, and the officer was at once shot down. The
soldiers immediately broke into the room where the hostages were
confined, every one being a chief of prominence in the tribe and
butchered them to the last man.</p>
<p>It was now war to the end. Led by Oconostota, the Cherokee descended
upon the frontier settlements of Carolina, while the warriors across
the mountains laid close siege to Fort Loudon. In June, 1760, a strong
force of over 1,600 men, under Colonel Montgomery, started to reduce
the Cherokee towns and relieve the beleaguered garrison. Crossing the
Indian frontier, Montgomery quickly drove the enemy from about Fort
Prince George and then, rapidly advancing, surprised Little Keowee,
killing every man of the defenders, and destroyed in succession every
one of the Lower Cherokee towns, burning them to the ground, cutting
down the cornfields and orchards, killing and taking more than a
hundred of their men, and driving the whole population into the
mountains before him. His own loss was very slight. He then sent
messengers to the Middle and Upper towns, summoning them to surrender
on penalty of the like fate, but, receiving no reply, he led his men
across the divide to the waters of the Little Tennessee and continued
down that stream without opposition until he came in the vicinity of
Echoee (Itse&prime;y&#301;), a few miles above the sacred town of
N&#301;kw&#259;s&#301;&prime;, the present Franklin, North Carolina.
Here the Cherokee had collected their full force to resist his
progress, and the result was a desperate engagement on June 27, 1760,
by which Montgomery was compelled to retire to Fort Prince George,
after losing nearly one hundred men in killed and wounded. The Indian
loss is unknown.</p>
<p>His retreat sealed the fate of Fort Loudon. The garrison, though
hard pressed and reduced to the necessity of eating horses and dogs,
had been enabled to hold out through the kindness of the Indian women,
many of whom, having found sweethearts among the soldiers, brought them
supplies of food daily. When threatened by the chiefs the women boldly
replied that the soldiers were their husbands and it was their duty to
help them, and that if any harm came to themselves for their devotion
their English relatives would avenge them.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2384src" href="#xd25e2384" name="xd25e2384src">88</a> The end was
only delayed, however, and on August 8, 1760, the garrison of about two
hundred men, under Captain Demer&eacute;, surrendered to Oconostota on
promise that they should be allowed to retire unmolested with their
arms and sufficient ammunition for the march, on condition of
delivering up all the remaining warlike stores.</p>
<p>The troops marched out and proceeded far enough to camp for the
night, while the Indians swarmed into the fort to see what plunder they
might find. &ldquo;By accident a discovery was made of ten bags of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>powder and a large quantity of ball that had been
secretly buried in the fort, to prevent their falling into the
enemy&rsquo;s hands&rdquo; (Hewat). It is said also that cannon, small
arms, and ammunition had been thrown into the river with the same
intention (Haywood). Enraged at this breach of the capitulation the
Cherokee attacked the soldiers next morning at daylight, killing
Demer&eacute; and twenty-nine others at the first fire. The rest were
taken and held as prisoners until ransomed some time after. The second
officer, Captain Stuart (13), for whom the Indians had a high regard,
was claimed by Ata-kullakulla, who soon after took him into the woods,
ostensibly on a hunting excursion, and conducted him for nine days
through the wilderness until he delivered him safely into the hands of
friends in Virginia. The chief&rsquo;s kindness was well rewarded, and
it was largely through his influence that peace was finally brought
about.</p>
<p>It was now too late, and the settlements were too much exhausted,
for another expedition, so the fall and winter were employed by the
English in preparations for an active campaign the next year in force
to crush out all resistance. In June 1761, Colonel Grant with an army
of 2,600 men, including a number of Chickasaw and almost every
remaining warrior of the Catawba,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2393src"
href="#xd25e2393" name="xd25e2393src">89</a> set out from Fort Prince
George. Refusing a request from Ata-kullakulla for a friendly
accommodation, he crossed Rabun gap and advanced rapidly down the
Little Tennessee along the same trail taken by the expedition of the
previous year. On June 10, when within two miles of Montgomery&rsquo;s
battlefield, he encountered the Cherokee, whom he defeated, although
with considerable loss to himself, after a stubborn engagement lasting
several hours. Having repulsed the Indians, he proceeded on his way,
sending out detachments to the outlying settlements, until in the
course of a month he had destroyed every one of the Middle towns, 15 in
all, with all their granaries and cornfields, driven the inhabitants
into the mountains, and &ldquo;pushed the frontier seventy miles
farther to the west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cherokee were now reduced to the greatest extremity. With some
of their best towns in ashes, their fields and orchards wasted for two
successive years, their ammunition nearly exhausted, many of their
bravest warriors dead, their people fugitives in the mountains, hiding
in caves and living like beasts upon roots or killing their horses for
food, with the terrible scourge of smallpox adding to the miseries of
starvation, and withal torn by factional differences which had existed
from the very beginning of the war&mdash;it was impossible for even
brave men to resist longer. In September Ata-kullakulla who had all
along done everything in his power to stay the disaffection, came down
to Charleston, a treaty of peace was made, and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>war was
ended. From an estimated population of at least 5,000 warriors some
years before, the Cherokee had now been reduced to about 2,300
men.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2403src" href="#xd25e2403" name=
"xd25e2403src">90</a></p>
<p>In the meantime a force of Virginians under Colonel Stephen had
advanced as far as the Great island of the Holston&mdash;now Kingsport,
Tennessee&mdash;where they were met by a large delegation of Cherokee,
who sued for peace, which was concluded with them by Colonel Stephen on
November 19, 1761, independently of what was being done in South
Carolina. On the urgent request of the chief that an officer might
visit their people for a short time to cement the new friendship,
Lieutenant Henry Timberlake, a young Virginian who had already
distinguished himself in active service, volunteered to return with
them to their towns, where he spent several months. He afterward
conducted a delegation of chiefs to England, where, as they had come
without authority from the Government, they met such an unpleasant
reception that they returned disgusted.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2408src" href="#xd25e2408" name="xd25e2408src">91</a></p>
<p>On the conclusion of peace between England and France in 1763, by
which the whole western territory was ceded to England, a great council
was held at Augusta, which was attended by the chiefs and principal men
of all the southern Indians, at which Captain John Stuart,
superintendent for the southern tribes, together with the colonial
governors of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia,
explained fully to the Indians the new condition of affairs, and a
treaty of mutual peace and friendship was concluded on November 10 of
that year.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2413src" href="#xd25e2413" name=
"xd25e2413src">92</a></p>
<p>Under several leaders, as Walker, Wallen, Smith, and Boon, the tide
of emigration now surged across the mountains in spite of every effort
to restrain it,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2421src" href="#xd25e2421"
name="xd25e2421src">93</a> and the period between the end of the
Cherokee war and the opening of the Revolution is principally notable
for a number of treaty cessions by the Indians, each in fruitless
endeavor to fix a permanent barrier between themselves and the
advancing wave of white settlement. Chief among these was the famous
Henderson purchase in 1775, which included the whole tract between the
Kentucky and Cumberland rivers, embracing the greater part of the
present state of Kentucky. By these treaties the Cherokee were shorn of
practically all their ancient territorial claims north of the present
Tennessee line and east of the Blue ridge and the Savannah, including
much of their best hunting range; their home settlements were, however,
left still in their possession.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2424src"
href="#xd25e2424" name="xd25e2424src">94</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span></p>
<p>As one consequence of the late Cherokee war, a royal proclamation
had been issued in 1763, with a view of checking future encroachments
by the whites, which prohibited any private land purchases from the
Indians, or any granting of warrants for lands west of the sources of
the streams flowing into the Atlantic.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2430src" href="#xd25e2430" name="xd25e2430src">95</a> In 1768, on
the appeal of the Indians themselves, the British superintendent for
the southern tribes, Captain John Stuart, had negotiated a treaty at
Hard Labor in South Carolina by which Kanawha and New rivers, along
their whole course downward from the North Carolina line, were fixed as
the boundary between the Cherokee and the whites in that direction. In
two years, however, so many borderers had crossed into the Indian
country, where they were evidently determined to remain, that it was
found necessary to substitute another treaty, by which the line was
made to run due south from the mouth of the Kanawha to the Holston,
thus cutting off from the Cherokee almost the whole of their hunting
grounds in Virginia and West Virginia. Two years later, in 1772, the
Virginians demanded a further cession, by which everything east of
Kentucky river was surrendered; and finally, on March 17, 1775, the
great Henderson purchase was consummated, including the whole tract
between the Kentucky and Cumberland rivers. By this last cession the
Cherokee were at last cut off from Ohio river and all their rich
Kentucky hunting grounds.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2433src" href=
"#xd25e2433" name="xd25e2433src">96</a></p>
<p>While these transactions were called treaties, they were really
forced upon the native proprietors, who resisted each in turn and
finally signed only under protest and on most solemn assurances that no
further demands would be made. Even before the purchases were made,
intruders in large numbers had settled upon each of the tracts in
question, and they refused to withdraw across the boundaries now
established, but remained on one pretext or another to await a new
adjustment. This was particularly the case on Watauga and upper Holston
rivers in northeastern Tennessee, where the settlers, finding
themselves still within the Indian boundary and being resolved to
remain, effected a temporary lease from the Cherokee in 1772. As was
expected and intended, the lease became a permanent occupancy, the
nucleus settlement of the future State of Tennessee.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e2439src" href="#xd25e2439" name="xd25e2439src">97</a></p>
<p>Just before the outbreak of the Revolution, the botanist, William
Bartram, made an extended tour of the Cherokee country, and has left us
a pleasant account of the hospitable character and friendly disposition
of the Indians at that time. He gives a list of forty-three towns then
inhabited by the tribe.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2444src" href=
"#xd25e2444" name="xd25e2444src">98</a></p>
<p>The opening of the great Revolutionary struggle in 1776 found the
Indian tribes almost to a man ranged on the British side against the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>Americans. There was good reason for this. Since
the fall of the French power the British government had stood to them
as the sole representative of authority, and the guardian and protector
of their rights against constant encroachments by the American
borderers. Licensed British traders were resident in every tribe and
many had intermarried and raised families among them, while the border
man looked upon the Indian only as a cumberer of the earth. The British
superintendents, Sir William Johnson in the north and Captain John
Stuart in the south, they knew as generous friends, while hardly a
warrior of them all was without some old cause of resentment against
their backwoods neighbors. They felt that the only barrier between
themselves and national extinction was in the strength of the British
government, and when the final severence came they threw their whole
power into the British scale. They were encouraged in this resolution
by presents of clothing and other goods, with promises of plunder from
the settlements and hopes of recovering a portion of their lost
territories. The British government having determined, as early as
June, 1775, to call in the Indians against the Americans, supplies of
hatchets, guns, and ammunition were issued to the warriors of all the
tribes from the lakes to the gulf, and bounties were offered for
American scalps brought in to the commanding officer at Detroit or
Oswego.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2451src" href="#xd25e2451" name=
"xd25e2451src">99</a> Even the Six Nations, who had agreed in solemn
treaty to remain neutral, were won over by these persuasions. In
August, 1775, an Indian &ldquo;talk&rdquo; was intercepted in which the
Cherokee assured Cameron, the resident agent, that their warriors,
enlisted in the service of the king, were ready at a signal to fall
upon the back settlements of Carolina and Georgia.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e2466src" href="#xd25e2466" name="xd25e2466src">100</a>
Circular letters were sent out to all those persons in the back country
supposed to be of royalist sympathies, directing them to repair to
Cameron&rsquo;s headquarters in the Cherokee country to join the
Indians in the invasion of the settlements.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2469src" href="#xd25e2469" name="xd25e2469src">101</a></p>
<p>In June, 1776, a British fleet under command of Sir Peter Parker,
with a large naval and military force, attacked Charleston, South
Carolina, both by land and sea, and simultaneously a body of Cherokee,
led by Tories in Indian disguise, came down from the mountains and
ravaged the exposed frontier of South Carolina, killing and burning as
they went. After a gallant defense by the garrison at Charleston the
British were repulsed, whereupon their Indian and Tory allies
withdrew.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2474src" href="#xd25e2474" name=
"xd25e2474src">102</a></p>
<p>About the same time the warning came from Nancy Ward (14), a noted
friendly Indian woman of great authority in the Cherokee Nation, that
seven hundred Cherokee warriors were advancing in two divisions against
the Watauga and Holston settlements, with the design of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>destroying everything as far up as New river. The
Holston men from both sides of the Virginia line hastily collected
under Captain Thompson and marched against the Indians, whom they met
and defeated with signal loss after a hard-fought battle near the Long
island in the Holston (Kingsport, Tennessee), on August 20. The next
day the second division of the Cherokee attacked the fort at Watauga,
garrisoned by only forty men under Captain James Robertson (15), but
was repulsed without loss to the defenders, the Indians withdrawing on
news of the result at the Long island. A Mrs. Bean and a boy named
Moore were captured on this occasion and carried to one of the Cherokee
towns in the neighborhood of Tellico, where the boy was burned, but the
woman, after she had been condemned to death and everything was in
readiness for the tragedy, was rescued by the interposition of Nancy
Ward. Two other Cherokee detachments moved against the upper
settlements at the same time. One of these, finding all the inhabitants
securely shut up in forts, returned without doing much damage. The
other ravaged the country on Clinch river almost to its head, and
killed a man and wounded others at Black&rsquo;s station, now Abingdon,
Virginia.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2481src" href="#xd25e2481" name=
"xd25e2481src">103</a></p>
<p>At the same time that one part of the Cherokee were raiding the
Tennessee settlements others came down upon the frontiers of Carolina
and Georgia. On the upper Catawba they killed many people, but the
whites took refuge in the stockade stations, where they defended
themselves until General Rutherford (16) came to their relief. In
Georgia an attempt had been made by a small party of Americans to seize
Cameron, who lived in one of the Cherokee towns with his Indian wife,
but, as was to have been expected, the Indians interfered, killing
several of the party and capturing others, who were afterward tortured
to death. The Cherokee of the Upper and Middle towns, with some Creeks
and Tories of the vicinity, led by Cameron himself, at once began
ravaging the South Carolina border, burning houses, driving off cattle,
and killing men, women, and children without distinction, until the
whole country was in a wild panic, the people abandoning their farms to
seek safety in the garrisoned forts. On one occasion an attack by two
hundred of the enemy, half of them being Tories, stripped and painted
like Indians, was repulsed by the timely arrival of a body of
Americans, who succeeded in capturing thirteen of the Tories. The
invasion extended into Georgia, where also property was destroyed and
the inhabitants were driven from their homes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2486src" href="#xd25e2486" name="xd25e2486src">104</a></p>
<p>Realizing their common danger, the border states determined to
strike such a concerted blow at the Cherokee as should render them
passive while the struggle with England continued. In accord with this
plan of cooperation the frontier forces were quickly mobilized and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>in the summer of 1776 four expeditions were
equipped from Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, to
enter the Cherokee territory simultaneously from as many different
directions.</p>
<p>In August of that year the army of North Carolina, 2,400 strong,
under General Griffith Rutherford, crossed the Blue ridge at Swannanoa
gap, and following the main trail almost along the present line of the
railroad, struck the first Indian town, Stik&acirc;&prime;y&#301;, or
Stecoee, on the Tuckasegee, near the present Whittier. The inhabitants
having fled, the soldiers burned the town, together with an unfinished
townhouse ready for the roof, cut down the standing corn, killed one or
two straggling Indians, and then proceeded on their mission of
destruction. Every town upon Oconaluftee, Tuckasegee, and the upper
part of Little Tennessee, and on Hiwassee to below the junction of
Valley river&mdash;thirty-six towns in all&mdash;was destroyed in turn,
the corn cut down or trampled under the hoofs of the stock driven into
the fields for that purpose, and the stock itself killed or carried
off. Before such an overwhelming force, supplemented as it was by three
others simultaneously advancing from other directions, the Cherokee
made but poor resistance, and fled with their women and children into
the fastnesses of the Great Smoky mountains, leaving their desolated
fields and smoking towns behind them. As was usual in Indian wars, the
actual number killed or taken was small, but the destruction of
property was beyond calculation. At Sugartown
(K&ucirc;lsetsi&prime;y&#301;, east of the present Franklin) one
detachment, sent to destroy it, was surprised, and escaped only through
the aid of another force sent to its rescue. Rutherford himself, while
proceeding to the destruction of the Hiwassee towns, encountered the
Indians drawn up to oppose his progress in the Waya gap of the
Nantahala mountains, and one of the hardest fights of the campaign
resulted, the soldiers losing over forty killed and wounded, although
the Cherokee were finally repulsed (17). One of the Indians killed on
this occasion was afterward discovered to be a woman, painted and armed
like a warrior.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2498src" href="#xd25e2498"
name="xd25e2498src">105</a></p>
<p>On September 26 the South Carolina army, 1,860 strong, under Colonel
Andrew Williamson, and including a number of Catawba Indians, effected
a junction with Rutherford&rsquo;s forces on Hiwassee river, near the
present Murphy, North Carolina. It had been expected that Williamson
would join the northern army at Cowee, on the Little Tennessee, when
they would proceed together against the western towns, but he had been
delayed, and the work of destruction in that direction was already
completed, so that after a short rest each army returned home along the
route by which it had come.</p>
<p>The South Carolina men had centered by different detachments in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>the lower Cherokee towns about the head of
Savannah river, burning one town after another, cutting down the peach
trees and ripened corn, and having an occasional brush with the
Cherokee, who hung constantly upon their flanks. At the town of Seneca,
near which they encountered Cameron with his Indians and Tories, they
had destroyed six thousand bushels of corn, besides other food stores,
after burning all the houses, the Indians having retreated after a
stout resistance. The most serious encounter had taken place at
Tomassee, where several whites and sixteen Cherokee were killed, the
latter being all scalped afterward. Having completed the ruin of the
Lower towns, Williamson had crossed over Rabun gap and descended into
the valley of the Little Tennessee to cooperate with Rutherford in the
destruction of the Middle and Valley towns. As the army advanced every
house in every settlement met was burned&mdash;ninety houses in one
settlement alone&mdash;and detachments were sent into the fields to
destroy the corn, of which the smallest town was estimated to have two
hundred acres, besides potatoes, beans, and orchards of peach trees.
The stores of dressed deerskins and other valuables were carried off.
Everything was swept clean, and the Indians who were not killed or
taken were driven, homeless refugees, into the dark recesses of
Nantahala or painfully made their way across to the Overhill towns in
Tennessee, which were already menaced by another invasion from the
north.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2510src" href="#xd25e2510" name=
"xd25e2510src">106</a></p>
<p>In July, while Williamson was engaged on the the upper Savannah, a
force of two hundred Georgians, under Colonel Samuel Jack, had marched
in the same direction and succeeded in burning two towns on the heads
of Chattahoochee and Tugaloo rivers, destroying the corn and driving
off the cattle, without the loss of a man, the Cherokee having
apparently fallen back to concentrate for resistance in the
mountains.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2515src" href="#xd25e2515" name=
"xd25e2515src">107</a></p>
<p>The Virginia army, about two thousand strong, under Colonel William
Christian (18), rendezvoused in August at the Long island of the
Holston, the regular gathering place on the Tennessee side of the
mountains. Among them were several hundred men from North Carolina,
with all who could be spared from the garrisons on the Tennessee side.
Paying but little attention to small bodies of Indians, who tried to
divert attention or to delay progress by flank attacks, they advanced
steadily, but cautiously, along the great Indian warpath (19) toward
the crossing of the French Broad, where a strong force of Cherokee was
reported to be in waiting to dispute their passage. Just before
reaching the river the Indians sent a Tory trader <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>with a
flag of truce to discuss terms. Knowing that his own strength was
overwhelming, Christian allowed the envoy to go through the whole camp
and then sent him back with the message that there could be no terms
until the Cherokee towns had been destroyed. Arriving at the ford, he
kindled fires and made all preparations as if intending to camp there
for several days. As soon as night fell, however, he secretly drew off
half his force and crossed the river lower down, to come upon the
Indians in their rear. This was a work of great difficulty; as the
water was so deep that it came up almost to the shoulders of the men,
while the current was so rapid that they were obliged to support each
other four abreast to prevent being swept off their feet. However, they
kept their guns and powder dry. On reaching the other side they were
surprised to find no enemy. Disheartened at the strength of the
invasion, the Indians had fled without even a show of resistance. It is
probable that nearly all their men and resources had been drawn off to
oppose the Carolina forces on their eastern border, and the few who
remained felt themselves unequal to the contest.</p>
<p>Advancing without opposition, Christian reached the towns on Little
Tennessee early in November, and, finding them deserted, proceeded to
destroy them, one after another, with their outlying fields. The few
lingering warriors discovered were all killed. In the meantime messages
had been sent out to the farther towns, in response to which several of
their head men came into Christian&rsquo;s camp to treat for peace. On
their agreement to surrender all the prisoners and captured stock in
their hands and to cede to the whites all the disputed territory
occupied by the Tennessee settlements, as soon as representatives of
the whole tribe could be assembled in the spring, Christian consented
to suspend hostilities and retire without doing further injury. An
exception was made against Tuskegee and another town, which had been
concerned in the burning of the boy taken from Watauga, already noted,
and these two were reduced to ashes. The sacred &ldquo;peace
town,&rdquo; Echota (20), had not been molested. Most of the troops
were disbanded on their return to the Long island, but a part remained
and built Fort Patrick Henry, where they went into winter
quarters.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2525src" href="#xd25e2525" name=
"xd25e2525src">108</a></p>
<p>From incidental notices in narratives written by some of the
participants, we obtain interesting side-lights on the merciless
character of this old border warfare. In addition to the ordinary
destruction of war&mdash;the burning of towns, the wasting of fruitful
fields, and the killing of the defenders&mdash;we find that every
Indian warrior killed was scalped, when opportunity permitted; women,
as well as men, were shot down and afterward &ldquo;helped to their
end&rdquo;; and prisoners taken were put up at auction as slaves when
not killed on the spot. Near Tomassee a small <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>party of
Indians was surrounded and entirely cut off. &ldquo;Sixteen were found
dead in the valley when the battle ended. These our men scalped.&rdquo;
In a personal encounter &ldquo;a stout Indian engaged a sturdy young
white man, who was a good bruiser and expert at gouging. After breaking
their guns on each other they laid hold of one another, when the
cracker had his thumbs instantly in the fellow&rsquo;s eyes, who roared
and cried &lsquo;<i>canaly</i>&rsquo;&mdash;enough, in English.
&lsquo;Damn you,&rsquo; says the white man, &lsquo;you can never have
enough while you are alive.&rsquo; He then threw him down, set his foot
upon his head, and scalped him alive; then took up one of the broken
guns and knocked out his brains. It would have been fun if he had let
the latter action alone and sent him home without his nightcap, to tell
his countrymen how he had been treated.&rdquo; Later on some of the
same detachment (Williamson&rsquo;s) seeing a woman ahead, fired on her
and brought her down with two serious wounds, but yet able to speak.
After getting what information she could give them, through a
half-breed interpreter, &ldquo;the informer being unable to travel,
some of our men favored her so far that they killed her there, to put
her out of pain.&rdquo; A few days later &ldquo;a party of Colonel
Thomas&rsquo;s regiment, being on a hunt of plunder, or some such
thing, found an Indian squaw and took her prisoner, she being lame, was
unable to go with her friends. She was so sullen that she would, as an
old saying is, neither lead nor drive, and by their account she died in
their hands; but I suppose they helped her to her end.&rdquo; At this
place&mdash;on the Hiwassee&mdash;they found a large town, having
&ldquo;upwards of ninety houses, and large quantities of corn,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;we encamped among the corn, where we had a great plenty of
corn, peas, beans, potatoes, and hogs,&rdquo; and on the next day
&ldquo;we were ordered to assemble in companies to spread through the
town to destroy, cut down, and burn all the vegetables belonging to our
heathen enemies, which was no small undertaking, they being so
plentifully supplied.&rdquo; Continuing to another town, &ldquo;we
engaged in our former labor, that is, cutting and destroying all things
that might be of advantage to our enemies. Finding here curious
buildings, great apple trees, and white-man-like improvements, these we
destroyed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2535src" href="#xd25e2535"
name="xd25e2535src">109</a></p>
<p>While crossing over the mountains Rutherford&rsquo;s men approached
a house belonging to a trader, when one of his negro slaves ran out and
&ldquo;was shot by the Reverend James Hall, the chaplain, as he ran,
mistaking him for an Indian.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2540src"
href="#xd25e2540" name="xd25e2540src">110</a> Soon after they captured
two women and a boy. It was proposed to auction them off at once to the
highest bidder, and when one of the officers protested that the matter
should be left to the disposition of Congress, &ldquo;the greater part
swore bloodily that if they were not sold for slaves upon the spot they
would kill and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>scalp them immediately.&rdquo; The prisoners were
accordingly sold for about twelve hundred dollars.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e2545src" href="#xd25e2545" name="xd25e2545src">111</a></p>
<p>At the Wolf Hills settlement, now Abingdon, Virginia, a party sent
out from the fort returned with the scalps of eleven warriors. Having
recovered the books which their minister had left behind in his cabin,
they held a service of prayer for their success, after which the fresh
scalps were hung upon a pole above the gate of the fort. The barbarous
custom of scalping to which the border men had become habituated in the
earlier wars was practiced upon every occasion when opportunity
presented, at least upon the bodies of warriors, and the South Carolina
legislature offered a bounty of seventy-five pounds for every
warrior&rsquo;s scalp, a higher reward, however, being offered for
prisoners.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2550src" href="#xd25e2550" name=
"xd25e2550src">112</a> In spite of all the bitterness which the war
aroused there seems to be no record of any scalping of Tories or other
whites by the Americans (21).</p>
<p>The effect upon the Cherokee of this irruption of more than six
thousand armed enemies into their territory was well nigh paralyzing.
More than fifty of their towns had been burned, their orchards cut
down, their fields wasted, their cattle and horses killed or driven
off, their stores of buckskin and other personal property plundered.
Hundreds of their people had been killed or had died of starvation and
exposure, others were prisoners in the hands of the Americans, and some
had been sold into slavery. Those who had escaped were fugitives in the
mountains, living upon acorns, chestnuts, and wild game, or were
refugees with the British.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2558src" href=
"#xd25e2558" name="xd25e2558src">113</a> From the Virginia line to the
Chattahoochee the chain of destruction was complete. For the present at
least any further resistance was hopeless, and they were compelled to
sue for peace.</p>
<p>By a treaty concluded at DeWitts Corners in South Carolina on May
20, 1777, the first ever made with the new states, the Lower Cherokee
surrendered to the conqueror all of their remaining territory in South
Carolina, excepting a narrow strip along the western boundary. Just two
months later, on July 20, by treaty at the Long island, as had been
arranged by Christian in the preceding fall, the Middle and Upper
Cherokee ceded everything east of the Blue ridge, together with all the
disputed territory on the Watauga, Nolichucky, upper Holston, and New
rivers. By this second treaty also Captain James Robertson was
appointed agent for the Cherokee, to reside at Echota, to watch their
movements, recover any captured property, and prevent their
correspondence with persons unfriendly to the American cause. As the
Federal government was not yet in perfect operation these treaties
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>were negotiated by commissioners from the four
states adjoining the Cherokee country, the territory thus acquired
being parceled out to South Carolina, North Carolina, and
Tennessee.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2568src" href="#xd25e2568" name=
"xd25e2568src">114</a></p>
<p>While the Cherokee Nation had thus been compelled to a treaty of
peace, a very considerable portion of the tribe was irreconcilably
hostile to the Americans and refused to be a party to the late
cessions, especially on the Tennessee side. Although Ata-kullakulla
sent word that he was ready with five hundred young warriors to fight
for the Americans against the English or Indian enemy whenever called
upon, Dragging-canoe (Tsiyu-g&ucirc;nsi&prime;n&#301;), who had led the
opposition against the Watauga settlements, declared that he would hold
fast to Cameron&rsquo;s talk and continue to make war upon those who
had taken his hunting grounds. Under his leadership some hundreds of
the most warlike and implacable warriors of the tribe, with their
families, drew out from the Upper and Middle towns and moved far down
upon Tennessee river, where they established new settlements on
Chickamauga creek, in the neighborhood of the present Chattanooga. The
locality appears to have been already a rendezvous for a sort of Indian
banditti, who sometimes plundered boats disabled in the rapids at this
point while descending the river. Under the name
&ldquo;Chickamaugas&rdquo; they soon became noted for their
uncompromising and never-ceasing hostility. In 1782, in consequence of
the destruction of their towns by Sevier and Campbell, they abandoned
this location and moved farther down the river, where they built, what
were afterwards known as the &ldquo;five lower towns,&rdquo; viz,
Running Water, Nickajack, Long Island, Crow town, and Lookout Mountain
town. These were all on the extreme western Cherokee frontier, near
where Tennessee river crosses the state line, the first three being
within the present limits of Tennessee, while Lookout Mountain town and
Crow town were respectively in the adjacent corners of Georgia and
Alabama. Their population was recruited from Creeks, Shawano, and white
Tories, until they were estimated at a thousand warriors. Here they
remained, a constant thorn in the side of Tennessee, until their towns
were destroyed in 1794.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2579src" href=
"#xd25e2579" name="xd25e2579src">115</a></p>
<p>The expatriated Lower Cherokee also removed to the farthest
<span class="corr" id="xd25e2593" title=
"Source: west-tern">western</span> border of their tribal territory,
where they might hope to be secure from encroachment for a time at
least, and built new towns for themselves on the upper waters of the
Coosa. Twenty years afterward <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href=
"#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>Hawkins found the population of
Willstown, in extreme western Georgia, entirely made up of refugees
from the Savannah, and the children so familiar from their parents with
stories of Williamson&rsquo;s invasion that they ran screaming from the
face of a white man (22).<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2598src" href=
"#xd25e2598" name="xd25e2598src">116</a></p>
<p>In April, 1777, the legislature of North Carolina, of which
Tennessee was still a part, authorized bounties of land in the new
territory to all able-bodied men who should volunteer against the
remaining hostile Cherokee. Under this act companies of rangers were
kept along the exposed border to cut off raiding parties of Indians and
to protect the steady advance of the pioneers, with the result that the
Tennessee settlements enjoyed a brief respite and were even able to
send some assistance to their brethren in Kentucky, who were sorely
pressed by the Shawano and other northern tribes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2603src" href="#xd25e2603" name="xd25e2603src">117</a></p>
<p>The war between England and the colonies still continued, however,
and the British government was unremitting in its effort to secure the
active assistance of the Indians. With the Creeks raiding the Georgia
and South Carolina frontier, and with a British agent, Colonel Brown,
and a number of Tory refugees regularly domiciled at
Chickamauga,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2608src" href="#xd25e2608"
name="xd25e2608src">118</a> it was impossible for the Cherokee long to
remain quiet. In the spring of 1779 the warning came from Robertson,
stationed at Echota, that three hundred warriors from Chickamauga had
started against the back-settlements of North Carolina. Without a
day&rsquo;s delay the states of North Carolina (including Tennessee)
and Virginia united to send a strong force of volunteers against them
under command of Colonels Shelby and Montgomery. Descending the Holston
in April in a fleet of canoes built for the occasion, they took the
Chickamauga towns so completely by surprise that the few warriors
remaining fled to the mountains without attempting to give battle.
Several were killed, Chickamauga and the outlying villages were burned,
twenty thousand bushels of corn were destroyed and large numbers of
horses and cattle captured, together with a great quantity of goods
sent by the British Governor Hamilton at Detroit for distribution to
the Indians. The success of this expedition frustrated the execution of
a project by Hamilton for uniting all the northern and southern
Indians, to be assisted by British regulars, in a concerted attack
along the whole American frontier. On learning, through runners, of the
blow that had befallen them, the Chickamauga warriors gave up all idea
of invading the settlements, and returned to their wasted
villages.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2614src" href="#xd25e2614" name=
"xd25e2614src">119</a> They, as well as the Creeks, however, kept in
constant communication with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>the British commander in Savannah. In
this year also a delegation of Cherokee visited the Ohio towns to offer
condolences on the death of the noted Delaware chief,
White-eyes.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2622src" href="#xd25e2622" name=
"xd25e2622src">120</a></p>
<p>In the early spring of 1780 a large company of emigrants under
Colonel John Donelson descended the Holston and the Tennessee to the
Ohio, whence they ascended the Cumberland, effected a junction with
another party under Captain James Robertson, which had just arrived by
a toilsome overland route, and made the first settlement on the present
site of Nashville. In passing the Chickamauga towns they had run the
gauntlet of the hostile Cherokee, who pursued them for a considerable
distance beyond the whirlpool known as the Suck, where the river breaks
through the mountain. The family of a man named Stuart being infected
with the smallpox, his boat dropped behind, and all on board,
twenty-eight in number, were killed or taken by the Indians, their
cries being distinctly heard by their friends ahead who were unable to
help them. Another boat having run upon the rocks, the three women in
it, one of whom had become a mother the night before, threw the cargo
into the river, and then, jumping into the water, succeeded in pushing
the boat into the current while the husband of one of them kept the
Indians at bay with his rifle. The infant was killed in the confusion.
Three cowards attempted to escape, without thought of their companions.
One was drowned in the river; the other two were captured and carried
to Chickamauga, where one was burned and the other was ransomed by a
trader. The rest went on their way to found the capital of a new
commonwealth.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2628src" href="#xd25e2628"
name="xd25e2628src">121</a> As if in retributive justice, the smallpox
broke out in the Chickamauga band in consequence of the capture of
Stuart&rsquo;s family, causing the death of a great number.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2634src" href="#xd25e2634" name=

<p>The British having reconquered Georgia and South Carolina and
destroyed all resistance in the south, early in 1780 Cornwallis, with
his subordinates, Ferguson and the merciless Tarleton, prepared to
invade North Carolina and sweep the country northward to Virginia. The
Creeks under McGillivray (23), and a number of the Cherokee under
various local chiefs, together with the Tories, at once joined his
standard.</p>
<p>While the Tennessee backwoodsmen were gathered at a barbecue to
contest for a shooting prize, a paroled prisoner brought a demand from
Ferguson for their submission; with the threat, if they refused, that
he would cross the mountains, hang their leaders, kill every man found
in arms and burn every settlement. Up to this time the mountain men had
confined their effort to holding in check the Indian enemy, but now,
with the fate of the Revolution at stake, they felt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>that the
time for wider action had come. They resolved not to await the attack,
but to anticipate it. Without order or authority from Congress, without
tents, commissary, or supplies, the Indian fighters of Virginia, North
Carolina, and Tennessee quickly assembled at the Sycamore shoals of the
Watauga to the number of about one thousand men under Campbell of
Virginia, Sevier (24) and Shelby of Tennessee, and McDowell of North
Carolina. Crossing the mountains, they met Ferguson at Kings mountain
in South Carolina on October 7, 1780, and gained the decisive victory
that turned the tide of the Revolution in the South.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e2646src" href="#xd25e2646" name="xd25e2646src">123</a></p>
<p>It is in place here to quote a description of these men in buckskin,
white by blood and tradition, but half Indian in habit and instinct,
who, in half a century of continuous conflict, drove back Creeks,
Cherokee, and Shawano, and with one hand on the plow and the other on
the rifle redeemed a wilderness and carried civilization and free
government to the banks of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were led by leaders they trusted, they were wonted to
Indian warfare, they were skilled as horsemen and marksmen, they knew
how to face every kind of danger, hardship, and privation. Their
fringed and tasseled hunting shirts were girded by bead-worked belts,
and the trappings of their horses were stained red and yellow. On their
heads they wore caps of coon skin or mink skin, with the tails hanging
down, or else felt hats, in each of which was thrust a buck tail or a
sprig of evergreen. Every man carried a small-bore rifle, a tomahawk,
and a scalping knife. A very few of the officers had swords, and there
was not a bayonet nor a tent in the army.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2656src" href="#xd25e2656" name="xd25e2656src">124</a></p>
<p>To strike the blow at Kings mountain the border men had been forced
to leave their own homes unprotected. Even before they could cross the
mountains on their return the news came that the Cherokee were again
out in force for the destruction of the upper settlements, and their
numerous small bands were killing, burning, and plundering in the usual
Indian fashion. Without loss of time the Holston settlements of
Virginia and Tennessee at once raised seven hundred mounted riflemen to
march against the enemy, the command being assigned to Colonel Arthur
Campbell of Virginia and Colonel John Sevier of Tennessee.</p>
<p>Sevier started first with nearly three hundred men, going south
along the great Indian war trail and driving small parties of the
Cherokee before him, until he crossed the French Broad and came upon
seventy of them on Boyds creek, not far from the present Sevierville,
on December 16, 1780. Ordering his men to spread out into a half
circle, he sent ahead some scouts, who, by an attack and feigned
retreat, managed to draw the Indians into the trap thus prepared,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>with the result that they left thirteen dead and
all their plunder, while not one of the whites was even
wounded.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2665src" href="#xd25e2665" name=
"xd25e2665src">125</a></p>
<p>A few days later Sevier was joined by Campbell with the remainder of
the force. Advancing to the Little Tennessee with but slight
resistance, they crossed three miles below Echota while the Indians
were watching for them at the ford above. Then dividing into two
bodies, they proceeded to destroy the towns along the river. The chiefs
sent peace talks through Nancy Ward, the Cherokee woman who had so
befriended the whites in 1776, but to these overtures Campbell returned
an evasive answer until he could first destroy the towns on lower
Hiwassee, whose warriors had been particularly hostile. Continuing
southward, the troops destroyed these towns, Hiwassee and Chestuee,
with all their stores of provisions, finishing the work on the last day
of the year. The Indians had fled before them, keeping spies out to
watch their movements. One of these, while giving signals from a ridge
by beating a drum, was shot by the whites. The soldiers lost only one
man, who was buried in an Indian cabin which was then burned down to
conceal the trace of the interment. The return march was begun on New
Year&rsquo;s day. Ten principal towns, including Echota, the capital,
had been destroyed, besides several smaller villages, containing in the
aggregate over one thousand houses, and not less than fifty thousand
bushels of corn and large stores of other provision. Everything not
needed on the return march was committed to the flames or otherwise
wasted. Of all the towns west of the mountains only Talassee, and one
or two about Chickamauga or on the headwaters of the Coosa, escaped.
The whites had lost only one man killed and two wounded. Before the
return a proclamation was sent to the Cherokee chiefs, warning them to
make peace on penalty of a worse visitation.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2673src" href="#xd25e2673" name="xd25e2673src">126</a></p>
<p>Some Cherokee who met them at Echota, on the return march, to talk
of peace, brought in and surrendered several white prisoners.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2681src" href="#xd25e2681" name=
"xd25e2681src">127</a> One reason for the slight resistance made by the
Indians was probably the fact that at the very time of the invasion
many of their warriors were away, raiding on the Upper Holston and in
the neighborhood of Cumberland gap.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2684src"
href="#xd25e2684" name="xd25e2684src">128</a></p>
<p>Although the Upper or Overhill Cherokee were thus humbled, those of
the middle towns, on the head waters of Little Tennessee, still
continued to send out parties against the back settlements. Sevier
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>determined to make a sudden stroke upon them, and
early in March of the same year, 1781, with 150 picked horsemen, he
started to cross the Great Smoky mountains over trails never before
attempted by white men, and so rough in places that it was hardly
possible to lead horses. Falling unexpectedly upon Tuckasegee, near the
present Webster, North Carolina, he took the town completely by
surprise, killing several warriors and capturing a number of women and
children. Two other principal towns and three smaller settlements were
taken in the same way, with a quantity of provision and about 200
horses, the Indians being entirely off their guard and unprepared to
make any effective resistance. Having spread destruction through the
middle towns, with the loss to himself of only one man killed and
another wounded, he was off again as suddenly as he had come, moving so
rapidly that he was well on his homeward way before the Cherokee could
gather for pursuit.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2691src" href=
"#xd25e2691" name="xd25e2691src">129</a> At the same time a smaller
Tennessee expedition went out to disperse the Indians who had been
making headquarters in the mountains about Cumberland gap and harassing
travelers along the road to Kentucky.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2700src" href="#xd25e2700" name="xd25e2700src">130</a> Numerous
indications of Indians were found, but none were met, although the
country was scoured for a considerable distance.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2706src" href="#xd25e2706" name="xd25e2706src">131</a> In summer
the Cherokee made another incursion, this time upon the new settlements
on the French Broad, near the present Newport, Tennessee. With a
hundred horsemen Sevier fell suddenly upon their camp on Indian creek,
killed a dozen warriors, and scattered the rest.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2709src" href="#xd25e2709" name="xd25e2709src">132</a> By these
successive blows the Cherokee were so worn out and dispirited that they
were forced to sue for peace, and in midsummer of 1781 a treaty of
peace&mdash;doubtful though it might be&mdash;was negotiated at the
Long island of the Holston.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2713src" href=
"#xd25e2713" name="xd25e2713src">133</a> The respite came just in time
to allow the Tennesseeans to send a detachment against Cornwallis.</p>
<p>Although there was truce in Tennessee, there was none in the South.
In November of this year the Cherokee made a sudden inroad upon the
Georgia settlements, destroying everything in their way. In retaliation
a force under General Pickens marched into their country, destroying
their towns as far as Valley river. Finding further progress blocked by
heavy snows and learning through a prisoner that the Indians, who had
retired before him, were collecting to oppose him in the mountains, he
withdrew, as he says, &ldquo;through absolute necessity,&rdquo; having
accomplished very little of the result expected. Shortly afterward the
Cherokee, together with some Creeks, again invaded Georgia,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>but were met on Oconee river and driven back by a
detachment of American troops.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2720src"
href="#xd25e2720" name="xd25e2720src">134</a></p>
<p>The Overhill Cherokee, on lower Little Tennessee, seem to have been
trying in good faith to hold to the peace established at the Long
island. Early in 1781 the government land office had been closed to
further entries, not to be opened again until peace had been declared
with England, but the borderers paid little attention to the law in
such matters, and the rage for speculation in Tennessee lands grew
stronger daily.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2732src" href="#xd25e2732"
name="xd25e2732src">135</a> In the fall of 1782 the chief, Old Tassel
of Echota, on behalf of all the friendly chiefs and towns, sent a
pathetic talk to the governors of Virginia and North Carolina,
complaining that in spite of all their efforts to remain quiet the
settlers were constantly encroaching upon them, and had built houses
within a day&rsquo;s walk of the Cherokee towns. They asked that all
those whites who had settled beyond the boundary last established
should be removed.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2738src" href=
"#xd25e2738" name="xd25e2738src">136</a> As was to have been expected,
this was never done.</p>
<p>The Chickamauga band, however, and those farther to the south, were
still bent on war, being actively encouraged in that disposition by the
British agents and refugee loyalists living among them. They continued
to raid both north and south, and in September, 1782, Sevier, with 200
mounted men, again made a descent upon their towns, destroying several
of their settlements about Chickamauga creek, and penetrating as far as
the important town of Ustana&prime;li, on the headwaters of Coosa
river, near the present Calhoun, Georgia. This also he destroyed. Every
warrior found was killed, together with a white man found in one of the
towns, whose papers showed that he had been active in inciting the
Indians to war. On the return the expedition halted at Echota, where
new assurances were received from the friendly element.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2743src" href="#xd25e2743" name=
"xd25e2743src">137</a> In the meantime a Georgia expedition of over 400
men, under General Pickens, had been ravaging the Cherokee towns in the
same quarter, with such effect that the Cherokee were forced to
purchase peace by a further surrender of territory on the head of Broad
river in Georgia.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2746src" href="#xd25e2746"
name="xd25e2746src">138</a> This cession was concluded at a treaty of
peace held with the Georgia commissioners at Augusta in the next year,
and was confirmed later by the Creeks, who claimed an interest in the
same lands, but was never accepted by either as the voluntary act of
their tribe as a whole.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2749src" href=
"#xd25e2749" name="xd25e2749src">139</a></p>
<p>By the preliminary treaty of Paris, November 30, 1782, the long
Revolutionary struggle for independence was brought to a close, and the
Cherokee, as well as the other tribes, seeing the hopelessness of
continuing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>the contest alone, began to sue for peace. By
seven years of constant warfare they had been reduced to the lowest
depth of misery, almost indeed to the verge of extinction. Over and
over again their towns had been laid in ashes and their fields wasted.
Their best warriors had been killed and their women and children had
sickened and starved in the mountains. Their great war chief,
Oconostota, who had led them to victory in 1780, was now a broken old
man, and in this year, at Echota, formally resigned his office in favor
of his son, The Terrapin. To complete their brimming cup of misery the
smallpox again broke out among them in 1783.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2756src" href="#xd25e2756" name="xd25e2756src">140</a> Deprived
of the assistance of their former white allies they were left to their

Cowee town,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2762src" href="#xd25e2762" name=
"xd25e2762src">141</a> and the way was left open to an arrangement. In

Cherokee and made regulations for the government of traders among
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2765src" href="#xd25e2765" name=

REMOVAL&mdash;1785&ndash;1838</h4>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Passing over several unsatisfactory and generally
abortive negotiations conducted by the various state governments in
1783&ndash;84, including the treaty of Augusta already noted,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2777src" href="#xd25e2777" name=
"xd25e2777src">143</a> we come to the turning point in the history of
the Cherokee, their first treaty with the new government of the United
States for peace and boundary delimitation, concluded at Hopewell (25)
in South Carolina on November 28, 1785. Nearly one thousand Cherokee
attended, the commissioners for the United States being Colonel
Benjamin Hawkins (26), of North Carolina; General Andrew Pickens, of
South Carolina; Cherokee Agent Joseph Martin, of Tennessee, and Colonel
Lachlan McIntosh, of Georgia. The instrument was signed by thirty-seven
chiefs and principal men, representing nearly as many different towns.
The negotiations occupied ten days, being complicated by a protest on
the part of North Carolina and Georgia against the action of the
government commissioners in confirming to the Indians some lands which
had already been appropriated as bounty lands for state troops without
the consent of the Cherokee. On the other hand the Cherokee complained
that 3,000 white settlers were at that moment in occupancy of unceded
land between the Holston and the French Broad. In spite of their
protest these intruders were allowed to remain, although the territory
was not acquired by treaty until some years later. As finally arranged
the treaty left the Middle and Upper towns, and those in the vicinity
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>of Coosa river, undisturbed, while the whole
country east of the Blue ridge, with the Watauga and Cumberland
settlements, was given over to the whites. The general boundary
followed the dividing ridge between Cumberland river and the more
southern waters of the Tennessee eastward to the junction of the two
forks of Holston, near the present Kingsport, Tennessee, thence
southward to the Blue ridge and southwestward to a point not far from
the present Atlanta, Georgia, thence westward to the Coosa river and
northwestward to a creek running into Tennessee river at the western
line of Alabama, thence northward with the Tennessee river to the
beginning. The lands south and west of these lines were recognized as
belonging to the Creeks and Chickasaw. Hostilities were to cease and
the Cherokee were taken under the protection of the United States. The
proceedings ended with the distribution of a few presents.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2782src" href="#xd25e2782" name=
"xd25e2782src">144</a></p>
<p>While the Hopewell treaty defined the relations of the Cherokee to
the general government and furnished a safe basis for future
negotiation, it yet failed to bring complete peace and security.
Thousands of intruders were still settled on Indian lands, and minor
aggressions and reprisals were continually occurring. The Creeks and
the northern tribes were still hostile and remained so for some years
later, and their warriors, cooperating with those of the implacable
Chickamauga towns, continued to annoy the exposed settlements,
particularly on the Cumberland. The British had withdrawn from the
South, but the Spaniards and French, who claimed the lower Mississippi
and the Gulf region and had their trading posts in west Tennessee, took
every opportunity to encourage the spirit of hostility to the
Americans.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2793src" href="#xd25e2793" name=
"xd25e2793src">145</a> But the spirit of the Cherokee nation was broken
and the Holston settlements were now too surely established to be
destroyed.</p>
<p>The Cumberland settlements founded by Robertson and Donelson in the
winter of 1779&ndash;80 had had but short respite. Early in spring the
Indians&mdash;Cherokee, Creeks, Chickasaw, and northern
Indians&mdash;had begun a series of attacks with the design of driving
these intruders from their lands, and thenceforth for years no
man&rsquo;s life was safe outside the stockade. The long list of
settlers shot down at work or while hunting in the woods, of stock
stolen and property destroyed, while of sorrowful interest to those
most nearly concerned, is too tedious for recital here, and only
leading events need be chronicled. Detailed notice may be found in the
works of local historians.</p>
<p>On the night of January 15, 1781, a band of Indians stealthily
approached Freeland&rsquo;s station and had even succeeded in
unfastening <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>the strongly barred gate when Robertson, being
awake inside, heard the noise and sprang up just in time to rouse the
garrison and beat off the assailants, who continued to fire through the
loopholes after they had been driven out of the fort. Only two
Americans were killed, although the escape was a narrow one.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2805src" href="#xd25e2805" name=
"xd25e2805src">146</a></p>
<p>About three months later, on April 2, a large body of Cherokee
approached the fort at Nashville (then called Nashborough, or simply
&ldquo;the Bluff&rdquo;), and by sending a decoy ahead succeeded in
drawing a large part of the garrison into an ambush. It seemed that
they would be cut off, as the Indians were between them and the fort,
when those inside loosed the dogs, which rushed so furiously upon the
Indians that the latter found, work enough to defend themselves, and
were finally forced to retire, carrying with them, however, five
American scalps.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2810src" href="#xd25e2810"
name="xd25e2810src">147</a></p>
<p>The attacks continued throughout this and the next year to such an
extent that it seemed at one time as if the Cumberland settlements must
be abandoned, but in June, 1783, commissioners from Virginia and North
Carolina arranged a treaty near Nashville (Nashborough) with chiefs of
the Chickasaw, Cherokee, and Creeks. This treaty, although it did not
completely stop the Indian inroads, at least greatly diminished them.
Thereafter the Chickasaw remained friendly, and only the Cherokee and
Creeks continued to make trouble.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2815src"
href="#xd25e2815" name="xd25e2815src">148</a></p>
<p>The valley towns on Hiwassee, as well as those of Chickamauga, seem
to have continued hostile. In 1786 a large body of their warriors, led
by the mixed-blood chief, John Watts, raided the new settlements in the
vicinity of the present Knoxville, Tennessee. In retaliation Sevier
again marched his volunteers across the mountain to the valley towns
and destroyed three of them, killing a number of warriors; but he
retired on learning that the Indians were gathering to give him
battle.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2820src" href="#xd25e2820" name=
"xd25e2820src">149</a> In the spring of this year Agent Martin,
stationed at Echota, had made a tour of inspection of the Cherokee
towns and reported that they were generally friendly and anxious for
peace, with the exception of the Chickamauga band, under
Dragging-canoe, who, acting with the hostile Creeks and encouraged by
the French and Spaniards, were making preparations to destroy the
Cumberland settlements. Notwithstanding the friendly professions of the
others, a party sent out to obtain satisfaction for the murder of four
Cherokee by the Tennesseeans had come back with fifteen white scalps,
and sent word to Sevier that they wanted peace, but if the whites
wanted war they would get it.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2823src" href=
"#xd25e2823" name="xd25e2823src">150</a> With lawless men on both sides
it is evident that peace was in jeopardy. In August, in consequence of
further killing and reprisals, commissioners of the new &ldquo;state of
Franklin,&rdquo; as Tennessee was now <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>called, concluded a
negotiation, locally known as the &ldquo;treaty of Coyatee,&rdquo; with
the chiefs of the Overhill towns. In spite of references to peace,
love, and brotherly friendship, it is very doubtful if the era of good
will was in any wise hastened by the so-called treaty, as the
Tennesseeans, who had just burned another Indian town in reprisal for
the killing of a white man, announced, without mincing words, that they
had been given by North Carolina&mdash;against which state, by the way,
they were then in organized rebellion&mdash;the whole country north of
the Tennessee river as far west as the Cumberland mountain, and that
they intended to take it &ldquo;by the sword, which is the best right
to all countries.&rdquo; As the whole of this country was within the
limits of the territory solemnly guaranteed to the Cherokee by the
Hopewell treaty only the year before, the chiefs simply replied that
Congress had said nothing to them on the subject, and so the matter
rested.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2828src" href="#xd25e2828" name=
"xd25e2828src">151</a> The theory of state&rsquo;s rights was too
complicated for the Indian understanding.</p>
<p>While this conflict between state and federal authority continued,
with the Cherokee lands as the prize, there could be no peace. In
March, 1787, a letter from Echota, apparently written by Agent Martin,
speaks of a recent expedition against the Cherokee towns, and the
confusion and alarm among them in consequence of the daily
encroachments of the &ldquo;Franklinites&rdquo; or Tennesseeans, who
had proceeded to make good their promise by opening a land office for
the sale of all the lands southward to Tennessee river, including even
a part of the beloved town of Echota. At the same time messengers were
coming to the Cherokee from traders in the foreign interest, telling
them that England, France, and Spain had combined against the Americans
and urging them with promises of guns and ammunition to join in the
war.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2833src" href="#xd25e2833" name=
"xd25e2833src">152</a> As a result each further advance of the
Tennessee settlements, in defiance as it was of any recognized treaty,
was stubbornly contested by the Indian owners of the land. The record
of these encounters, extending over a period of several years, is too
tedious for recital. &ldquo;Could a diagram be drawn, accurately
designating every spot signalized by an Indian <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e2836" title="Source: massacree">massacre</span>, surprise, or
depredation, or courageous attack, defense, pursuit, or victory by the
whites, or station or fort or battlefield, or personal encounter, the
whole of that section of country would be studded over with
delineations of such incidents. Every spring, every ford, every path,
every farm, every trail, every house nearly, in its first settlement,
was once the scene of danger, exposure, attack, exploit, achievement,
death.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2839src" href="#xd25e2839"
name="xd25e2839src">153</a> The end was the winning of Tennessee.</p>
<p>In the meantime the inroads of the Creeks and their Chickamauga
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>allies upon the Georgia frontier and the
Cumberland settlements around Nashville became so threatening that
measures were taken for a joint campaign by the combined forces of
Georgia and Tennessee (&ldquo;Franklin&rdquo;). The enterprise came to
naught through the interference of the federal authorities.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2846src" href="#xd25e2846" name=
"xd25e2846src">154</a> All through the year 1788 we hear of attacks and
reprisals along the Tennessee border, although the agent for the
Cherokee declared in his official report that, with the exception of
the Chickamauga band, the Indians wished to be at peace if the whites
would let them. In March two expeditions under Sevier and Kennedy set
out against the towns in the direction of the French Broad. In May
several persons of a family named Kirk were murdered a few miles south
of Knoxville. In retaliation Sevier raised a large party and marching
against a town on Hiwassee river&mdash;one of those which had been
destroyed some years before and rebuilt&mdash;and burned it, killing a
number of the inhabitants in the river while they were trying to
escape. He then turned, and proceeding to the towns on Little Tennessee
burned several of them also, killing a number of Indians. Here a small
party of Indians, including Abraham and Tassel, two well-known friendly
chiefs, was brutally massacred by one of the Kirks, no one interfering,
after they had voluntarily come in on request of one of the officers.
This occurred during the temporary absence of Sevier. Another
expedition under Captain Fayne was drawn into an ambuscade at Citico
town and lost several in killed and wounded. The Indians pursued the
survivors almost to Knoxville, attacking a small station near the
present Maryville by the way. They were driven off by Sevier and
others, who in turn invaded the Indian settlements, crossing the
mountains and penetrating as far as the valley towns on Hiwassee,
hastily retiring as they found the Indians gathering in their
front.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2849src" href="#xd25e2849" name=
"xd25e2849src">155</a> In the same summer another expedition was
organized against the Chickamauga towns. The chief command was given to
General Martin, who left White&rsquo;s fort, now Knoxville, with four
hundred and fifty men and made a rapid march to the neighborhood of the
present Chattanooga, where the main force encamped on the site of an
old Indian settlement. A detachment sent ahead to surprise a town a few
miles farther down the river was fired upon and driven back, and a
general engagement took place in the narrow pass between the bluff and
the river, with such disastrous results that three captains were killed
and the men so badly demoralized that they refused to advance. Martin
was compelled to turn back, after burying the dead officers in a large
townhouse, which was then burned down to conceal the grave.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2852src" href="#xd25e2852" name=
"xd25e2852src">156</a></p>
<p>In October a large party of Cherokee and Creeks attacked
Gillespie&rsquo;s station, south of the present Knoxville. The small
garrison was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>overpowered after a short resistance, and
twenty-eight persons, including several women and children, were
killed. The Indians left behind a letter signed by four chiefs,
including John Watts, expressing regret for what they called the
accidental killing of the women and children, reminding the whites of
their own treachery in killing Abraham and the Tassel, and defiantly
concluding, &ldquo;When you move off the land, then we will make
peace.&rdquo; Other exposed stations were attacked, until at last
Sevier again mustered a force, cleared the enemy from the frontier, and
pursued the Indians as far as their towns on the head waters of Coosa
river, in such vigorous fashion that they were compelled to ask for
terms of peace and agree to a surrender of prisoners, which was
accomplished at Coosawatee town, in upper Georgia, in the following
April.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2859src" href="#xd25e2859" name=

<p>Among the captives thus restored to their friends were Joseph Brown,
a boy of sixteen, with his two younger sisters, who, with several
others, had been taken at Nickajack town while descending the Tennessee
in a flatboat nearly a year before. His father and the other men of the
party, about ten in all, had been killed at the time, while the mother
and several other children were carried to various Indian towns, some
of them going to the Creeks, who had aided the Cherokee in the capture.
Young Brown, whose short and simple narrative is of vivid interest, was
at first condemned to death, but was rescued by a white man living in
the town and was afterward adopted into the family of the chief, in
spite of the warning of an old Indian woman that if allowed to live he
would one day guide an army to destroy them. The warning was strangely
prophetic, for it was Brown himself who guided the expedition that
finally rooted out the Chickamauga towns a few years later. When
rescued at Coosawatee he was in Indian costume, with shirt,
breechcloth, scalp lock, and holes bored in his ears. His little
sister, five years old, had become so attached to the Indian woman who
had adopted her, that she refused to go to her own mother and had to be
pulled along by force.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2865src" href=
"#xd25e2865" name="xd25e2865src">158</a> The mother and another of the
daughters, who had been taken by the Creeks, were afterwards ransomed
by McGillivray, head chief of the Creek Nation, who restored them to
their friends, generously refusing any compensation for his
kindness.</p>
<p>An arrangement had been made with the Chickasaw, in 1783, by which
they surrendered to the Cumberland settlement their own claim to the
lands from the Cumberland river south to the dividing ridge of Duck
river.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2870src" href="#xd25e2870" name=
"xd25e2870src">159</a> It was not, however, until the treaty of
Hopewell, two years later, that the Cherokee surrendered their claim to
the same region, and even then the Chickamauga warriors, with their
allies, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>hostile Creeks and Shawano, refused to acknowledge
the cession and continued their attacks, with the avowed purpose of
destroying the new settlements. Until the final running of the boundary
line, in 1797, Spain claimed all the territory west of the mountains
and south of Cumberland river, and her agents were accused of stirring
up the Indians against the Americans, even to the extent of offering
rewards for American scalps.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2875src" href=
"#xd25e2875" name="xd25e2875src">160</a> One of these raiding parties,
which had killed the brother of Captain Robertson, was tracked to
Coldwater, a small mixed town of Cherokee and Creeks, on the south side
of Tennessee river, about the present Tuscumbia, Alabama. Robertson
determined to destroy it, and taking a force of volunteers, with a
couple of Chickasaw guides, crossed the Tennessee without being
discovered and surprised and burnt the town. The Indians, who numbered
less than fifty men, attempted to escape to the river, but were
surrounded and over twenty of them killed, with a loss of but one man
to the Tennesseeans. In the town were found also several French
traders. Three of these, who refused to surrender, were killed,
together with a white woman who was accidentally shot in one of the
boats. The others were afterward released, their large stock of trading
goods having been taken and sold for the benefit of the troops. The
affair took place about the end of June, 1787. Through this action, and
an effort made by Robertson about the same time to come to an
understanding with the Chickamauga band, there was a temporary
cessation of hostile inroads upon the Cumberland, but long before the
end of the year the attacks were renewed to such an extent that it was
found necessary to keep out a force of rangers with orders to scour the
country and kill every Indian found east of the Chickasaw
boundary.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2878src" href="#xd25e2878" name=
"xd25e2878src">161</a></p>
<p>The Creeks seeming now to be nearly as much concerned in these raids
as the Cherokee, a remonstrance was addressed to McGillivray, their
principal chief, who replied that, although the Creeks, like the other
southern tribes, had adhered to the British interest during the
Revolution, they had accepted proposals of friendship, but while
negotiations were pending six of their people had been killed in the
affair at Coldwater, which had led to a renewal of hostile feeling. He
promised, however, to use his best efforts to bring about peace, and
seems to have kept his word, although the raids continued through this
and the next year, with the usual sequel of pursuit and reprisal. In
one of these skirmishes a company under Captain Murray followed some
Indian raiders from near Nashville to their camp on Tennessee river and
succeeded in killing the whole party of eleven warriors.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2883src" href="#xd25e2883" name=
"xd25e2883src">162</a> A treaty of peace was signed with the Creeks in
1790, but, owing to the intrigues of the Spaniards, it had little
practical effect,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2886src" href="#xd25e2886"
name="xd25e2886src">163</a> and not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68"

victory over the confederated northern tribes in 1794 and the final
destruction of the Nickajack towns in the same year did real peace came
to the frontier.</p>
<p>By deed of cession of February 25, 1790, Tennessee ceased to be a
part of North Carolina and was organized under federal laws as
&ldquo;The Territory of the United States south of the Ohio
river,&rdquo; preliminary to taking full rank as a state six years
later. William Blount (27) was appointed first territorial governor and
also superintendent for the southern Indians, with a deputy resident
with each of the four principal tribes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2893src" href="#xd25e2893" name="xd25e2893src">164</a> Pensacola,
Mobile, St. Louis, and other southern posts were still held by the
Spaniards, who claimed the whole country south of the Cumberland, while
the British garrisons had not yet been withdrawn from the north. The
resentment of the Indians at the occupancy of their reserved and
guaranteed lands by the whites was sedulously encouraged from both
quarters, and raids along the Tennessee frontier were of common
occurrence. At this time, according to the official report of President
Washington, over five hundred families of intruders were settled upon
lands belonging rightly to the Cherokee, in addition to those between
the French Broad and the Holston.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2896src"
href="#xd25e2896" name="xd25e2896src">165</a> More than a year before
the Secretary of War had stated that &ldquo;the disgraceful violation
of the treaty of Hopewell with the Cherokee requires the serious
consideration of Congress. If so direct and manifest contempt of the
authority of the United States be suffered with impunity, it will be in
vain to attempt to extend the arm of government to the frontiers. The
Indian tribes can have no faith in such imbecile promises, and the
lawless whites will ridicule a government which shall on paper only
make Indian treaties and regulate Indian boundaries.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2902src" href="#xd25e2902" name=
"xd25e2902src">166</a> To prevent any increase of the dissatisfaction,
the general government issued a proclamation forbidding any further
encroachment upon the Indian lands on Tennessee river; notwithstanding
which, early in 1791, a party of men descended the river in boats, and,
landing on an island at the Muscle shoals, near the present Tuscumbia,
Alabama, erected a blockhouse and other defensive works. Immediately
afterward the Cherokee chief, Glass, with about sixty warriors,
appeared and quietly informed them that if they did not at once
withdraw he would kill them. After some parley the intruders retired to
their boats, when the Indians set fire to the buildings and reduced
them to ashes.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2905src" href="#xd25e2905"
name="xd25e2905src">167</a></p>
<p>To forestall more serious difficulty it was necessary to negotiate a
new treaty with a view to purchasing the disputed territory.
Accordingly, through the efforts of Governor Blount, a convention was
held with the principal men of the Cherokee at White&rsquo;s fort, now
Knoxville, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>Tennessee, in the summer of 1791. With much
difficulty the Cherokee were finally brought to consent to a cession of
a triangular section in Tennessee and North Carolina extending from
Clinch river almost to the Blue ridge, and including nearly the whole
of the French Broad and the lower Holston, with the sites of the
present Knoxville, Greenville, and Asheville. The whole of this area,
with a considerable territory adjacent, was already fully occupied by
the whites. Permission was also given for a road from the eastern
settlements to those on the Cumberland, with the free navigation of
Tennessee river. Prisoners on both sides were to be restored and
perpetual peace was guaranteed. In consideration of the lands
surrendered the Cherokee were to receive an annuity of one thousand
dollars with some extra goods and some assistance on the road to
civilization. A treaty was signed by forty-one principal men of the
tribe and was concluded July 2, 1791. It is officially described as
being held &ldquo;on the bank of the Holston, near the mouth of the
French Broad,&rdquo; and is commonly spoken of as the &ldquo;treaty of
Holston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cherokee, however, were dissatisfied with the arrangement, and
before the end of the year a delegation of six principal chiefs
appeared at Philadelphia, then the seat of government, without any
previous announcement of their coming, declaring that when they had
been summoned by Governor Blount to a conference they were not aware
that it was to persuade them to sell lands; that they had resisted the
proposition for days, and only yielded when compelled by the persistent
and threatening demands of the governor; that the consideration was
entirely too small; and that they had no faith that the whites would
respect the new boundary, as they were in fact already settling beyond
it. Finally, as the treaty had been signed, they asked that these
intruders be removed. As their presentation of the case seemed a just
one and it was desirable that they should carry home with them a
favorable impression of the government&rsquo;s attitude toward them, a
supplementary article was added, increasing the annuity to eight
thousand five hundred dollars. On account of renewed Indian hostilities
in Ohio valley and the desire of the government to keep the good will
of the Cherokee long enough to obtain their help against the northern
tribes, the new line was not surveyed until 1797.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2914src" href="#xd25e2914" name="xd25e2914src">168</a></p>
<p>As illustrating Indian custom it may be noted that one of the
principal signers of the original treaty was among the protesting
delegates, but having in the meantime changed his name, it appears on
the supplementary paragraph as &ldquo;Iskagua, or Clear Sky, formerly
Nenetooyah, or Bloody Fellow.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2919src" href="#xd25e2919" name="xd25e2919src">169</a> As he had
been one of the principal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href=
"#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>raiders on the Tennessee frontier,
the new name may have been symbolic of his change of heart at the
prospect of a return of peace.</p>
<p>The treaty seems to have had little effect in preventing Indian
hostilities, probably because the intruders still remained upon the
Indian lands, and raiding still continued. The Creeks were known to be
responsible for some of the mischief, and the hostile Chickamaugas were
supposed to be the chief authors of the rest.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2926src" href="#xd25e2926" name="xd25e2926src">170</a> Even while
the Cherokee delegates were negotiating the treaty in Philadelphia a
boat which had accidentally run aground on the Muscle shoals was
attacked by a party of Indians under the pretense of offering
assistance, one man being killed and another severely wounded with a
hatchet.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2929src" href="#xd25e2929" name=
"xd25e2929src">171</a></p>
<p>While these negotiations had been pending at Philadelphia a young
man named Leonard D. Shaw, a student at Princeton college, had
expressed to the Secretary of War an earnest desire for a commission
which would enable him to accompany the returning Cherokee delegates to
their southern home, there to study Indian life and characteristics. As
the purpose seemed a useful one, and he appeared well qualified for
such a work, he was accordingly commissioned as deputy agent to reside
among the Cherokee to observe and report upon their movements, to aid
in the annuity distributions, and to render other assistance to
Governor Blount, superintendent for the southern tribes, to study their
language and home life, and to collect materials for an Indian history.
An extract from the official instructions under which this first United
States ethnologist began his work will be of interest. After defining
his executive duties in connection with the annuity distributions, the
keeping of accounts and the compiling of official reports, Secretary
Knox continues&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">A due performance of your duty will probably require
the exercise of all your patience and fortitude and all your knowledge
of the human character. The school will be a severe but interesting
one. If you should succeed in acquiring the affections and a knowledge
of the characters of the southern Indians, you may be at once useful to
the United States and advance your own interest.</p>
<p>You will endeavor to learn their languages; this is essential to
your communications. You will collect materials for a history of all
the southern tribes and all things thereunto belonging. You will
endeavor to ascertain their respective limits, make a vocabulary of
their respective languages, teach them agriculture and such useful arts
as you may know or can acquire. You will correspond regularly with
Governor Blount, who is superintendent for Indian affairs, and inform
him of all occurrences. You will also cultivate a correspondence with
Brigadier-General McGillivray [the Creek chief], and you will also keep
a journal of your proceedings and transmit them to the War
Office&#8202;&hellip;. You are to exhibit to Governor Blount the
Cherokee book and all the writings therein, the messages to the several
tribes of Indians, and these instructions.</p>
<p>Your route will be hence to Reading; thence Harris&rsquo;s ferry
[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania] to Carlisle; to &mdash;&mdash; ferry on the
Potomac; to Winchester; to Staunton; to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>&mdash;&mdash;, and to
Holston. I should hope that you would travel upwards of twenty miles
each day, and that you would reach Holston in about thirty
days.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2946src" href="#xd25e2946" name=

</blockquote>
<p>The journey, which seemed then so long, was to be made by wagons
from Philadelphia to the head of navigation on Holston river, thence by
boats to the Cherokee towns. Shaw seems to have taken up his residence
at Ustanali, which had superseded Echota as the Cherokee capital. We
hear of him as present at a council there in June of the same year,
with no evidence of unfriendliness at his presence.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e2954src" href="#xd25e2954" name="xd25e2954src">173</a> The
friendly feeling was of short continuance, however, for a few months
later we find him writing from Ustanali to Governor Blount that on
account of the aggressive hostility of the Creeks, whose avowed
intention was to kill every white man they met, he was not safe 50
yards from the house. Soon afterwards the Chickamauga towns again
declared war, on which account, together with renewed threats by the
Creeks, he was advised by the Cherokee to leave Ustanali, which he did
early in September, 1792, proceeding to the home of General Pickens,
near Seneca, South Carolina, escorted by a guard of friendly Cherokee.
In the following winter he was dismissed from the service on serious
charges, and his mission appears to have been a failure.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2957src" href="#xd25e2957" name=
"xd25e2957src">174</a></p>
<p>To prevent an alliance of the Cherokee, Creeks, and other southern
Indians with the confederated hostile northern tribes, the government
had endeavored to persuade the former to furnish a contingent of
warriors to act with the army against the northern Indians, and special
instruction had been given to Shaw to use his efforts for this result.
Nothing, however, came of the attempt. St Clair&rsquo;s defeat turned
the scale against the United States, and in September, 1792, the
Chickamauga towns formally declared war.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2962src" href="#xd25e2962" name="xd25e2962src">175</a></p>
<p>In November of this year the governor of Georgia officially reported
that a party of lawless Georgians had gone into the Cherokee Nation,
and had there burned a town and barbarously killed three Indians, while
about the same time two other Cherokee had been killed within the
settlements. Fearing retaliation, he ordered out a patrol of troops to
guard the frontier in that direction, and sent a conciliatory letter to
the chiefs, expressing his regret for what had happened. No answer was
returned to the message, but a few days later an entire family was
found murdered&mdash;four women, three children, and a young
man&mdash;all scalped and mangled and with arrows sticking in the
bodies, while, according to old Indian war custom, two war clubs were
left upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>the ground to show by whom the deed was done. So
swift was savage vengeance.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2970src" href=
"#xd25e2970" name="xd25e2970src">176</a></p>
<p>Early in 1792 a messenger who had been sent on business for Governor
Blount to the Chickamauga towns returned with the report that a party
had just come in with prisoners and some fresh scalps, over which the
chiefs and warriors of two towns were then dancing; that the Shawano
were urging the Cherokee to join them against the Americans; that a
strong body of Creeks was on its way against the Cumberland
settlements, and that the Creek chief, McGillivray, was trying to form
a general confederacy of all the Indian tribes against the whites. To
understand this properly it must be remembered that at this time all
the tribes northwest of the Ohio and as far as the heads of the
Mississippi were banded together in a grand alliance, headed by the
warlike Shawano, for the purpose of holding the Ohio river as the
Indian boundary against the advancing tide of white settlement. They
had just cut to pieces one of the finest armies ever sent into the
West, under the veteran General St Clair (28), and it seemed for the
moment as if the American advance would be driven back behind the
Alleghenies.</p>
<p>In the emergency the Secretary of War directed Governor Blount to
hold a conference with the chiefs of the Chickasaw, Choctaw, and
Cherokee at Nashville in June to enlist their warriors, if possible, in
active service against the northern tribes. The conference was held as
proposed, in August, but nothing seems to have come of it, although the
chiefs seemed to be sincere in their assurances of friendship. Very few
of the Choctaw or Cherokee were in attendance. At the annuity
distribution of the Cherokee, shortly before, the chiefs had also been
profuse in declarations of their desire for peace.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e2980src" href="#xd25e2980" name="xd25e2980src">177</a>
Notwithstanding all this the attacks along the Tennessee frontier
continued to such an extent that the blockhouses were again put in
order and garrisoned. Soon afterwards the governor reported to the
Secretary of War that the five lower Cherokee towns on the Tennessee
(the Chickamauga), headed by John Watts, had finally declared war
against the United States, and that from three to six hundred warriors,
including a hundred Creeks, had started against the settlements. The
militia was at once called out, both in eastern Tennessee and on the
Cumberland. On the Cumberland side it was directed that no pursuit
should be continued beyond the Cherokee boundary, the ridge between the
waters of Cumberland and Duck rivers. The order issued by Colonel
White, of Knox county, to each of his captains shows how great was the
alarm: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first dateline"><span class="sc">Knoxville</span>,
<i>September 11, 1792</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>: You are hereby commanded to repair with
your company to Knoxville, equipped, to protect the frontiers; there is
imminent danger. Bring with you two days&rsquo; provisions, if

</blockquote>
<p>About midnight on the 30th of September, 1792, the Indian force,
consisting of several hundred Chickamaugas and other Cherokee, Creeks,
and Shawano, attacked Buchanan&rsquo;s station, a few miles south of
Nashville. Although numbers of families had collected inside the
stockade for safety, there were less than twenty able-bodied men among
them. The approach of the enemy alarmed the cattle, by which the
garrison had warning just in time to close the gate when the Indians
were already within a few yards of the entrance. The assault was
furious and determined, the Indians rushing up to the stockade,
attempting to set fire to it, and aiming their guns through the port
holes. One Indian succeeded in climbing upon the roof with a lighted
torch, but was shot and fell to the ground, holding his torch against
the logs as he drew his last breath. It was learned afterward that he
was a half blood, the stepson of the old white trader who had once
rescued the boy Joseph Brown at Nickajack. He was a desperate warrior
and when only twenty-two years of age had already taken six white
scalps. The attack was repulsed at every point, and the assailants
finally drew off, with considerable loss, carrying their dead and
wounded with them, and leaving a number of hatchets, pipes, and other
spoils upon the ground. Among the wounded was the chief John Watts. Not
one of those in the fort was injured. It has been well said that the
defense of Buchanan&rsquo;s station by such a handful of men against an
attacking force estimated all the way at from three to seven hundred
Indians is a feat of bravery which has scarcely been surpassed in the
annals of border warfare. The effect upon the Indians must have been
thoroughly disheartening.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3007src" href=
"#xd25e3007" name="xd25e3007src">179</a></p>
<p>In the same month arrangements were made for protecting the frontier
along the French Broad by means of a series of garrisoned blockhouses,
with scouts to patrol regularly from one to another, North Carolina
cooperating on her side of the line. The hostile inroads still
continued in this section, the Creeks acting with the hostile Cherokee.
One raiding party of Creeks having been traced toward Chilhowee town on
Little Tennessee, the whites were about to burn that and a neighboring
Cherokee town when Sevier interposed and prevented.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e3015src" href="#xd25e3015" name="xd25e3015src">180</a> There
is no reason to suppose that the people of these towns were directly
concerned in the depredations along the frontier at this period,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>the mischief being done by those farther to the
south, in conjunction with the Creeks.</p>
<p>Toward the close of this year, 1792, Captain Samuel Handley, while
leading a small party of men to reenforce the Cumberland settlement,
was attacked by a mixed force of Cherokee, Creeks, and Shawano, near
the Crab Orchard, west of the present Kingston, Tennessee. Becoming
separated from his men he encountered a warrior who had lifted his
hatchet to strike when Handley seized the weapon, crying out
&ldquo;Canaly&rdquo; (for <i>hig&#301;na&prime;li&#301;</i>),
&ldquo;friend,&rdquo; to which the Cherokee responded with the same
word, at once lowering his arm. Handley was carried to Willstown, in
Alabama, where he was adopted into the Wolf clan (29) and remained
until the next spring. After having made use of his services in writing
a peace letter to Governor Blount the Cherokee finally sent him home in
safety to his friends under a protecting escort of eight warriors,
without any demand for ransom. He afterward resided near Tellico
blockhouse, near Loudon, where, after the wars were over, his Indian
friends frequently came to visit and stop with him.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e3025src" href="#xd25e3025" name="xd25e3025src">181</a></p>
<p>The year 1793 began with a series of attacks all along the Tennessee
frontier. As before, most of the depredation was by Chickamaugas and
Creeks, with some stray Shawano from the north. The Cherokee from the
towns on Little Tennessee remained peaceable, but their temper was
sorely tried by a regrettable circumstance which occurred in June.
While a number of friendly chiefs were assembled for a conference at
Echota, on the express request of the President, a party of men under
command of a Captain John Beard suddenly attacked them, killing about
fifteen Indians, including several chiefs and two women, one of them
being the wife of Hanging-maw (Ushw&acirc;&prime;li-g&ucirc;t&#259;),
principal chief of the Nation, who was himself wounded. The murderers
then fled, leaving others to suffer the consequences. Two hundred
warriors at once took up arms to revenge their loss, and only the most
earnest appeal from the deputy governor could restrain them from swift
retaliation. While the chief, whose wife was thus murdered and himself
wounded, forebore to revenge himself, in order not to bring war upon
his people, the Secretary of War was obliged to report, &ldquo;to my
great pain, I find to punish Beard by law just now is out of the
question.&rdquo; Beard was in fact arrested, but the trial was a farce
and he was acquitted.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3030src" href=
"#xd25e3030" name="xd25e3030src">182</a></p>
<p>Believing that the Cherokee Nation, with the exception of the
Chickamaugas, was honestly trying to preserve peace, the territorial
government, while making provision for the safety of the exposed
settlements, had strictly prohibited any invasion of the Indian
country. The frontier people were of a different opinion, and in spite
of the prohibition a company of nearly two hundred mounted men under
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>Colonels Doherty and McFarland crossed over the
mountains in the summer of this year and destroyed six of the middle
towns, returning with fifteen scalps and as many prisoners.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3037src" href="#xd25e3037" name=
"xd25e3037src">183</a></p>
<p>Late in September a strong force estimated at one thousand
warriors&mdash;seven hundred Creeks and three hundred
Cherokee&mdash;under John Watts and Doublehead, crossed the Tennessee
and advanced in the direction of Knoxville, where the public stores
were then deposited. In their eagerness to reach Knoxville they passed
quietly by one or two smaller settlements until within a short distance
of the town, when, at daybreak of the 25th, they heard the garrison
fire the sunrise gun and imagined that they were discovered.
Differences had already broken out among the leaders, and without
venturing to advance farther they contented themselves with an attack
upon a small blockhouse a few miles to the west, known as Cavitts
station, in which at the time were only three men with thirteen women
and children. After defending themselves bravely for some time these
surrendered on promise that they should be held for exchange, but as
soon as they came out Doublehead&rsquo;s warriors fell upon them and
put them all to death with the exception of a boy, who was saved by
John Watts. This bloody deed was entirely the work of Doublehead, the
other chiefs having done their best to prevent it.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e3042src" href="#xd25e3042" name="xd25e3042src">184</a></p>
<p>A force of seven hundred men under General Sevier was at once put
upon their track, with orders this time to push the pursuit into the
heart of the Indian nation. Crossing Little Tennessee and Hiwassee they
penetrated to Ustanali town, near the present Calhoun, Georgia. Finding
it deserted, although well filled with provision, they rested there a
few days, the Indians in the meantime attempting a night attack without
success. After burning the town, Sevier continued down the river to
Etowah town, near the present site of Rome. Here the
Indians&mdash;Cherokee and Creeks&mdash;had dug intrenchments and
prepared to make a stand, but, being outflanked, were defeated with
loss and compelled to retreat. This town, with several others in the
neighborhood belonging to both Cherokee and Creeks, was destroyed, with
all the provision of the Indians, including three hundred cattle, after
which the army took up the homeward march. The Americans had lost but
three men. This was the last military service of Sevier.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3050src" href="#xd25e3050" name=
"xd25e3050src">185</a></p>
<p>During the absence of Sevier&rsquo;s force in the south the Indians
made a sudden inroad on the French Broad, near the present Dandridge,
killing and scalping a woman and a boy. While their friends were
accompanying the remains to a neighboring burial ground for interment,
two men who had incautiously gone ahead were fired upon. One
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>of them escaped, but the other one was found
killed and scalped when the rest of the company came up, and was buried
with the first victims. Sevier&rsquo;s success brought temporary
respite to the Cumberland settlements. During the early part of the
year the Indian attacks by small raiding parties had been so frequent
and annoying that a force of men had been kept out on patrol service
under officers who adopted with some success the policy of hunting the
Indians in their camping places in the thickets, rather than waiting
for them to come into the settlements.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3057src" href="#xd25e3057" name="xd25e3057src">186</a></p>
<p>In February, 1794, the Territorial assembly of Tennessee met at
Knoxville and, among other business transacted, addressed a strong
memorial to Congress calling for more efficient protection for the
frontier and demanding a declaration of war against the Creeks and
Cherokee. The memorial states that since the treaty of Holston (July,
1791), these two tribes had killed in a most barbarous and inhuman
manner more than two hundred citizens of Tennessee, of both sexes, had
carried others into captivity, destroyed their stock, burned their
houses, and laid waste their plantations, had robbed the citizens of
their slaves and stolen at least two thousand horses. Special attention
was directed to the two great invasions in September, 1792, and
September, 1793, and the memorialists declare that there was scarcely a
man of the assembly but could tell of &ldquo;a dear wife or child, an
aged parent or near relation, besides friends, massacred by the hands
of these bloodthirsty nations in their house or fields.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3063src" href="#xd25e3063" name=
"xd25e3063src">187</a></p>
<p>In the meantime the raids continued and every scattered cabin was a
target for attack. In April a party of twenty warriors surrounded the
house of a man named Casteel on the French Broad about nine miles above
Knoxville and massacred father, mother, and four children in most
brutal fashion. One child only was left alive, a girl of ten years, who
was found scalped and bleeding from six tomahawk gashes, yet survived.
The others were buried in one grave. The massacre roused such a storm
of excitement that it required all the effort of the governor and the
local officials to prevent an invasion in force of the Indian country.
It was learned that Doublehead, of the Chickamauga towns, was trying to
get the support of the valley towns, which, however, continued to
maintain an attitude of peace. The friendly Cherokee also declared that
the Spaniards were constantly instigating the lower towns to
hostilities, although John Watts, one of their principal chiefs,
advocated peace.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3068src" href="#xd25e3068"
name="xd25e3068src">188</a></p>
<p>In June a boat under command of William Scott, laden with pots,
hardware, and other property, and containing six white men, three
women, four children, and twenty negroes, left Knoxville to descend
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>Tennessee river to Natchez. As it passed the
Chickamauga towns it was fired upon from Running Water and Long island
without damage. The whites returned the fire, wounding two Indians. A
large party of Cherokee, headed by White-man-killer
(Une&prime;ga-dih&#301;&prime;), then started in pursuit of the boat,
which they overtook at Muscle shoals, where they killed all the white
people in it, made prisoners of the negroes, and plundered the goods.
Three Indians were killed and one was wounded in the action.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3075src" href="#xd25e3075" name=
"xd25e3075src">189</a> It is said that the Indian actors in this
massacre fled across the Mississippi into Spanish territory and became
the nucleus of the Cherokee Nation of the West, as will be noted
elsewhere.</p>
<p>On June 26, 1794, another treaty, intended to be supplementary to
that of Holston in 1791, was negotiated at Philadelphia, being signed
by the Secretary of War and by thirteen principal men of the Cherokee.
An arrangement was made for the proper marking of the boundary then
established, and the annuity was increased to five thousand dollars,
with a proviso that fifty dollars were to be deducted for every horse
stolen by the Cherokee and not restored within three months.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3080src" href="#xd25e3080" name=
"xd25e3080src">190</a></p>
<p>In July a man named John Ish was shot down while plowing in his
field eighteen miles below Knoxville. By order of Hanging-maw, the
friendly chief of Echota, a party of Cherokee took the trail and
captured the murderer, who proved to be a Creek, whom they brought in
to the agent at Tellico blockhouse, where he was formally tried and
hanged. When asked the usual question he said that his people were at
war with the whites, that he had left home to kill or be killed, that
he had killed the white man and would have escaped but for the
Cherokee, and that there were enough of his nation to avenge his death.
A few days later a party of one hundred Creek warriors crossed
Tennessee river against the settlements. The alarm was given by
Hanging-maw, and fifty-three Cherokee with a few federal troops started
in pursuit. On the 10th of August they came up with the Creeks, killing
one and wounding another, one Cherokee being slightly wounded. The
Creeks retreated and the victors returned to the Cherokee towns, where
their return was announced by the death song and the firing of guns.
&ldquo;The night was spent in dancing the scalp dance, according to the
custom of warriors after a victory over their enemies, in which the
white and red people heartily joined. The Upper Cherokee had now
stepped too far to go back, and their professions of friendship were
now no longer to be questioned.&rdquo; In the same month there was an
engagement between a detachment of about <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>forty soldiers and a
large body of Creeks near Crab Orchard, in which several of each were
killed.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3090src" href="#xd25e3090" name=
"xd25e3090src">191</a> It is evident that much of the damage on both
sides of the Cumberland range was due to the Creeks.</p>
<p>In the meantime Governor Blount was trying to negotiate peace with
the whole Cherokee Nation, but with little success. The Cherokee
claimed to be anxious for permanent peace, but said that it was
impossible to restore the property taken by them, as it had been taken
in war, and they had themselves been equal losers from the whites. They
said also that they could not prevent the hostile Creeks from passing
through their territory. About the end of July it was learned that a
strong body of Creeks had started north against the settlements. The
militia was at once ordered out along the Tennessee frontier, and the
friendly Cherokees offered their services, while measures were taken to
protect their women and children from the enemy. The Creeks advanced as
far as Willstown, when the news came of the complete defeat of the
confederated northern tribes by General Wayne (30), and fearing the
same fate for themselves, they turned back and scattered to their
towns.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3095src" href="#xd25e3095" name=
"xd25e3095src">192</a></p>
<p>The Tennesseeans, especially those on the Cumberland, had long ago
come to the conclusion that peace could be brought about only through
the destruction of the Chickamauga towns. Anticipating some action of
this kind, which the general government did not think necessary or
advisable, orders against any such attempt had been issued by the
Secretary of War to Governor Blount. The frontier people went about
their preparations, however, and it is evident from the result that the
local military authorities were in connivance with the undertaking.
General Robertson was the chief organizer of the volunteers about
Nashville, who were reenforced by a company of Kentuckians under
Colonel Whitley. Major Ore had been sent by Governor Blount with a
detachment of troops to protect the Cumberland settlements, and on
arriving at Nashville entered as heartily into the project as if no
counter orders had ever been issued, and was given chief command of the
expedition, which for this reason is commonly known as
&ldquo;Ore&rsquo;s expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On September 7, 1794, the army of five hundred and fifty mounted men
left Nashville, and five days later crossed the Tennessee near the
mouth of the Sequatchee river, their guide being the same Joseph Brown
of whom the old Indian woman had said that he would one day bring the
soldiers to destroy them. Having left their horses on the other side of
the river, they moved up along the south bank just after daybreak of
the 13th and surprised the town of Nickajack, killing several warriors
and taking a number of prisoners. Some who attempted to escape in
canoes were shot in the water. The warriors <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>in
Running Water town, four miles above, heard the firing and came at once
to the assistance of their friends, but were driven back after
attempting to hold their ground, and the second town shared the fate of
the first. More than fifty Indians had been killed, a number were
prisoners, both towns and all their contents had been destroyed, with a
loss to the assailants of only three men wounded. The Breath, the chief
of Running Water, was among those killed. Two fresh scalps with a large
quantity of plunder from the settlements were found in the towns,
together with a supply of ammunition said to have been furnished by the
Spaniards.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3104src" href="#xd25e3104" name=
"xd25e3104src">193</a></p>
<p>Soon after the return of the expedition Robertson sent a message to
John Watts, the principal leader of the hostile Cherokee, threatening a
second visitation if the Indians did not very soon surrender their
prisoners and give assurances of peace.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3109src" href="#xd25e3109" name="xd25e3109src">194</a> The
destruction of their towns on Tennessee and Coosa and the utter defeat
of the northern confederates had now broken the courage of the
Cherokee, and on their own request Governor Blount held a conference
with them at Tellico blockhouse, November 7 and 8, 1794, at which
Hanging-maw, head chief of the Nation, and Colonel John Watt, principal
chief of the hostile towns, with about four hundred of their warriors,
attended. The result was satisfactory; all differences were arranged on
a friendly basis and the long Cherokee war came to an end.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3112src" href="#xd25e3112" name=
"xd25e3112src">195</a></p>
<p>Owing to the continued devastation of their towns during the
Revolutionary struggle, a number of Cherokee, principally of the
Chickamauga band, had removed across the Ohio about 1782 and settled on
Paint creek, a branch of the Scioto river, in the vicinity of their
friends and allies, the Shawano. In 1787 they were reported to number
about seventy warriors. They took an active part in the hostilities
along the Ohio frontier and were present in the great battle at the
Maumee rapids, by which the power of the confederated northern tribes
was effectually broken. As they had failed to attend the treaty
conference held at Greenville in August, 1795, General Wayne sent them
a special message, through their chief Long-hair, that if they refused
to come in and make terms as the others had done they would be
considered outside the protection of the government. Upon this a part
of them came in and promised that as soon as they could gather their
crops the whole band would leave Ohio forever and return to their
people in the south.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3117src" href=
"#xd25e3117" name="xd25e3117src">196</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Creeks were still hostile and continued their inroads upon the
western settlements. Early in January, 1795, Governor Blount held
another conference with the Cherokee and endeavored to persuade them to
organize a company of their young men to patrol the frontier against
the Creeks, but to this proposal the chiefs refused to
consent.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3123src" href="#xd25e3123" name=
"xd25e3123src">197</a></p>
<p>In the next year it was discovered that a movement was on foot to
take possession of certain Indian lands south of the Cumberland on
pretense of authority formerly granted by North Carolina for the relief
of Revolutionary soldiers. As such action would almost surely have
resulted in another Indian war, Congress interposed, on the
representation of President Washington, with an act for the regulation
of intercourse between citizens of the United States and the various
Indian tribes. Its main purpose was to prevent intrusion upon lands to
which the Indian title had not been extinguished by treaty with the
general government, and under its provisions a number of squatters were
ejected from the Indian country and removed across the boundary. The
pressure of border sentiment, however, was constantly for extending the
area of white settlement and the result was an immediate agitation to
procure another treaty cession.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3129src"
href="#xd25e3129" name="xd25e3129src">198</a></p>
<p>In consequence of urgent representations from the people of
Tennessee, Congress took steps in 1797 for procuring a new treaty with
the Cherokee by which the ejected settlers might be reinstated and the
boundaries of the new state so extended as to bring about closer
communication between the eastern settlements and those on the
Cumberland. The Revolutionary warfare had forced the Cherokee west and
south, and their capital and central gathering place was now Ustanali
town, near the present Calhoun, Georgia, while Echota, their ancient
capital and beloved peace town, was almost on the edge of the white
settlements. The commissioners wished to have the proceedings conducted
at Echota, while the Cherokee favored Ustanali. After some debate a
choice was made of a convenient place near Tellico blockhouse, where
the conference opened in July, but was brought to an abrupt close by
the peremptory refusal of the Cherokee to sell any lands or to permit
the return of the ejected settlers.</p>
<p>The rest of the summer was spent in negotiation along the lines
already proposed, and on October 2, 1798, a treaty, commonly known as
the &ldquo;first treaty of Tellico,&rdquo; was concluded at the same
place, and was signed by thirty-nine chiefs on behalf of the Cherokee.
By this treaty the Indians ceded a tract between Clinch river and the
Cumberland ridge, another along the northern bank of Little Tennessee
extending up to Chilhowee mountain, and a third in North Carolina on
the heads of French Broad and Pigeon rivers and including the sites
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>of the present Waynesville and Hendersonville.
These cessions included most or all of the lands from which settlers
had been ejected. Permission was also given for laying out the
&ldquo;Cumberland road,&rdquo; to connect the east Tennessee
settlements with those about Nashville. In consideration of the lands
and rights surrendered, the United States agreed to deliver to the
Cherokee five thousand dollars in goods, and to increase their existing
annuity by one thousand dollars, and as usual, to &ldquo;continue the
guarantee of the remainder of their country forever.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3138src" href="#xd25e3138" name=
"xd25e3138src">199</a></p>
<p>Wayne&rsquo;s victory over the northern tribes at the battle of the
Maumee rapids completely broke their power and compelled them to accept
the terms of peace dictated at the treaty of Greenville in the summer
of 1795. The immediate result was the surrender of the Ohio river
boundary by the Indians and the withdrawal of the British garrisons
from the interior posts, which up to this time they had continued to
hold in spite of the treaty made at the close of the Revolution. By the
treaty made at Madrid in October, 1795, Spain gave up all claim on the
east side of the Mississippi north of the thirty-first parallel, but on
various pretexts the formal transfer of posts was delayed and a Spanish
garrison continued to occupy San Fernando de Barrancas, at the present
Memphis, Tennessee, until the fall of 1797, while that at Natchez, in
Mississippi, was not surrendered until March, 1798. The Creeks, seeing
the trend of affairs, had made peace at Colerain, Georgia, in June,
1796. With the hostile European influence thus eliminated, at least for
the time, the warlike tribes on the north and on the south crushed and
dispirited and the Chickamauga towns wiped out of existence, the
Cherokee realized that they must accept the situation and, after nearly
twenty years of continuous warfare, laid aside the tomahawk to
cultivate the arts of peace and civilization.</p>
<p>The close of the century found them still a compact people (the
westward movement having hardly yet begun) numbering probably about
20,000 souls. After repeated cessions of large tracts of land, to some
of which they had but doubtful claim, they remained in recognized
possession of nearly 43,000 square miles of territory, a country about
equal in extent to Ohio, Virginia, or Tennessee. Of this territory
about one-half was within the limits of Tennessee, the remainder being
almost equally divided between Georgia and Alabama, with a small area
in the extreme southwestern corner of North Carolina.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e3145src" href="#xd25e3145" name="xd25e3145src">200</a> The old
Lower towns on Savannah river had been broken up for twenty years, and
the whites had so far encroached upon the Upper towns that the capital
and council fire of the nation had been removed from the ancient peace
town of Echota to Ustanali, in Georgia. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>towns on
Coosa river and in Alabama were almost all of recent establishment,
peopled by refugees from the east and north. The Middle towns, in North
Carolina, were still surrounded by Indian country.</p>
<p>Firearms had been introduced into the tribe about one hundred years
before, and the Cherokee had learned well their use. Such civilized
goods as hatchets, knives, clothes, and trinkets had become so common
before the first Cherokee war that the Indians had declared that they
could no longer live without the traders. Horses and other domestic
animals had been introduced early in the century, and at the opening of
the war of 1760, according to Adair, the Cherokee had &ldquo;a
prodigious number of excellent horses,&rdquo; and although hunger had
compelled them to eat a great many of these during that period, they
still had, in 1775, from two to a dozen each, and bid fair soon to have
plenty of the best sort, as, according to the same authority, they were
skilful jockeys and nice in their choice. Some of them had grown fond
of cattle, and they had also an abundance of hogs and poultry, the
Indian pork being esteemed better than that raised in the white
settlements on account of the chestnut diet.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3152src" href="#xd25e3152" name="xd25e3152src">201</a> In
Sevier&rsquo;s expedition against the towns on Coosa river, in 1793,
the army killed three hundred beeves at Etowah and left their carcasses
rotting on the ground. While crossing the Cherokee country in 1796
Hawkins met an Indian woman on horseback driving ten very fat cattle to
the settlements for sale. Peach trees and potatoes, as well as the
native corn and beans, were abundant in their fields, and some had bees
and honey and did a considerable trade in beeswax. They seem to have
quickly recovered from the repeated ravages of war, and there was a
general air of prosperity throughout the nation. The native arts of
pottery and basket-making were still the principal employment of the
women, and the warriors hunted with such success that a party of
traders brought down thirty wagon loads of skins on one trip.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3155src" href="#xd25e3155" name=
"xd25e3155src">202</a> In dress and house-building the Indian style was
practically unchanged.</p>
<p>In pursuance of a civilizing policy, the government had agreed, by
the treaty of 1791, to furnish the Cherokee gratuitously with farming
tools and similar assistance. This policy was continued and broadened
to such an extent that in 1801 Hawkins reports that &ldquo;in the
Cherokee agency, the wheel, the loom, and the plough is [<i>sic</i>] in
pretty general use, farming, manufactures, and stock raising the topic
of conversation among the men and women.&rdquo; At a conference held
this year we find the chiefs of the mountain towns complaining that the
people of the more western and southwestern settlements had received
more than their share of spinning wheels and cards, and were
consequently more advanced in making their own clothing as well as in
farming, to which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83"
name="pb83">83</a>]</span>the others retorted that these things had
been offered to all alike at the same time, but while the lowland
people had been quick to accept, the mountaineers had hung back.
&ldquo;Those who complain came in late. We have got the start of them,
which we are determined to keep.&rdquo; The progressives, under John
Watts, Doublehead, and Will, threatened to secede from the rest and
leave those east of Chilhowee mountain to shift for
themselves.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3165src" href="#xd25e3165" name=
"xd25e3165src">203</a> We see here the germ of dissatisfaction which
led ultimately to the emigration of the western band. Along with other
things of civilization, negro slavery had been introduced and several
of the leading men were now slaveholders (31).</p>
<p>Much of the advance in civilization had been due to the
intermarriage among them of white men, chiefly traders of the
ante-Revolutionary period, with a few Americans from the back
settlements. The families that have made Cherokee history were nearly
all of this mixed descent. The Doughertys, Galpins, and Adairs were
from Ireland; the Rosses, Vanns, and McIntoshes, like the McGillivrays
and Graysons among the Creeks, were of Scottish origin; the Waffords
and others were Americans from Carolina or Georgia, and the father of
Sequoya was a (Pennsylvania?) German. Most of this white blood was of
good stock, very different from the &ldquo;squaw man&rdquo; element of
the western tribes. Those of the mixed blood who could afford it
usually sent their children away to be educated, while some built
schoolhouses upon their own grounds and brought in private teachers
from the outside. With the beginning of the present century we find
influential mixed bloods in almost every town, and the civilized idea
dominated even the national councils. The Middle towns, shut in from
the outside world by high mountains, remained a stronghold of Cherokee
conservatism.</p>
<p>With the exception of Priber, there seems to be no authentic record
of any missionary worker among the Cherokee before 1800. There is,
indeed, an incidental notice of a Presbyterian minister of North
Carolina being on his way to the tribe in 1758, but nothing seems to
have come of it, and we find him soon after in South Carolina and
separated from his original jurisdiction.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3172src" href="#xd25e3172" name="xd25e3172src">204</a> The first
permanent mission was established by the Moravians, those peaceful
German immigrants whose teachings were so well exemplified in the lives
of Zeisberger and Heckewelder. As early as 1734, while temporarily
settled in Georgia, they had striven to bring some knowledge of the
Christian religion to the Indians immediately about Savannah, including
perhaps some stray Cherokee. Later on they established missions among
the Delawares in Ohio, where their first Cherokee convert was received
in 1773, being one who had been captured by the Delawares when a boy
and had grown up and married in the tribe. In 1752 they had formed a
settlement on the upper Yadkin, near the present Salem, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>North
Carolina, where they made friendly acquaintance with the
Cherokee.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3177src" href="#xd25e3177" name=
"xd25e3177src">205</a> In 1799, hearing that the Cherokee desired
teachers&mdash;or perhaps by direct invitation of the chiefs&mdash;two
missionaries visited the tribe to investigate the matter. Another visit
was made in the next summer, and a council was held at Tellico agency,
where, after a debate in which the Indians showed considerable
difference of opinion, it was decided to open a mission. Permission
having been obtained from the government, the work was begun in April,
1801, by Rev. Abraham Steiner and Rev. Gottlieb Byhan at the residence
of David Vann, a prominent mixed-blood chief, who lodged them in his
own house and gave them every assistance in building the mission, which
they afterward called Spring place, where now is the village of the
same name in Murray county, northwestern Georgia. They were also
materially aided by the agent, Colonel Return J. Meigs (32). It was
soon seen that the Cherokee wanted civilizers for their children, and
not new theologies, and when they found that a school could not at once
be opened the great council at Ustanali sent orders to the missionaries
to organize a school within six months or leave the nation. Through
Vann&rsquo;s help the matter was arranged and a school was opened,
several sons of prominent chiefs being among the pupils. Another
Moravian mission was established by Reverend J. Gambold at Oothcaloga,
in the same county, in 1821. Both were in flourishing condition when
broken up, with other Cherokee missions, by the State of Georgia in
1834. The work was afterward renewed beyond the Mississippi.<a class=

<p>In 1804 the Reverend Gideon Blackburn, a Presbyterian minister of
Tennessee, opened a school among the Cherokee, which continued for
several years until abandoned for lack of funds.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3185src" href="#xd25e3185" name="xd25e3185src">207</a></p>
<p>Notwithstanding the promise to the Cherokee in the treaty of 1798
that the Government would &ldquo;continue the guarantee of the
remainder of their country forever,&rdquo; measures were begun almost
immediately to procure another large cession of land and road
privileges. In spite of the strenuous objection of the Cherokee, who
sent a delegation of prominent chiefs to Washington to protest against
any further sales, such pressure was brought to bear, chiefly through
the efforts of the agent, Colonel Meigs, that the object of the
Government was accomplished, and in 1804 and 1805 three treaties were
negotiated at Tellico agency, by which the Cherokee were shorn of more
than eight thousand square miles of their remaining territory.</p>
<p>By the first of these treaties&mdash;October 24, 1804&mdash;a
purchase was made of a small tract in northeastern Georgia, known as
the &ldquo;Wafford <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85"
name="pb85">85</a>]</span>settlement,&rdquo; upon which a party led by
Colonel Wafford had located some years before, under the impression
that it was outside the boundary established by the Hopewell treaty. In
compensation the Cherokee were to receive an immediate payment of five
thousand dollars in goods or cash with an additional annuity of one
thousand dollars. By the other treaties&mdash;October 25 and 27,
1805&mdash;a large tract was obtained in central Tennessee and
Kentucky, extending between the Cumberland range and the western line
of the Hopewell treaty, and from Cumberland river southwest to Duck
river. One section was also secured at Southwest point (now Kingston,
Tennessee) with the design of establishing there the state capital,
which, however, was located at Nashville instead seven years later.
Permission was also obtained for two mail roads through the Cherokee
country into Georgia and Alabama. In consideration of the cessions by
the two treaties the United States agreed to pay fifteen thousand six
hundred dollars in working implements, goods, or cash, with an
additional annuity of three thousand dollars. To secure the consent of
some of the leading chiefs, the treaty commissioners resorted to the
disgraceful precedent of secret articles, by which several valuable
small tracts were reserved for Doublehead and Tollunteeskee, the
agreement being recorded as a part of the treaty, but not embodied in
the copy sent to the Senate for confirmation.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3195src" href="#xd25e3195" name="xd25e3195src">208</a> In
consequence of continued abuse of his official position for selfish
ends Doublehead was soon afterward killed in accordance with a decree
of the chiefs of the Nation, Major Ridge being selected as
executioner.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3198src" href="#xd25e3198"
name="xd25e3198src">209</a></p>
<p>By the treaty of October 25, 1805, the settlements in eastern
Tennessee were brought into connection with those about Nashville on
the Cumberland, and the state at last assumed compact form. The whole
southern portion of the state, as defined in the charter, was still
Indian country, and there was a strong and constant pressure for its
opening, the prevailing sentiment being in favor of making Tennessee
river the boundary between the two races. New immigrants were
constantly crowding in from the east, and, as Royce says, &ldquo;the
desire to settle on Indian land was as potent and insatiable with the
average border settler then as it is now.&rdquo; Almost within two
months of the last treaties another one was concluded at Washington on
January 7, 1806, by which the Cherokee ceded their claim to a large
tract between Duck river and the Tennessee, embracing nearly seven
thousand square miles in Tennessee and Alabama, together with the Long
island (Great island) in Holston river, which up to this time they had
claimed as theirs. They were promised in compensation ten thousand
dollars in five cash installments, a grist mill and cotton gin, and a
life annuity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>of one hundred dollars for Black-fox, the aged
head chief of the nation. The signers of the instrument, including
Doublehead and Tollunteeskee, were accompanied to Washington by the
same commissioners who had procured the previous treaty. In consequence
of some misunderstanding, the boundaries of the ceded tract were still
further extended in a supplementary treaty concluded at the Chickasaw
Old Fields on the Tennessee, on September 11, 1807. As the country
between Duck river and the Tennessee was claimed also by the Chickasaw,
their title was extinguished by separate treaties.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e3208src" href="#xd25e3208" name="xd25e3208src">210</a> The
ostensible compensation for this last Cherokee cession, as shown by the
treaty, was two thousand dollars, but it was secretly agreed by Agent
Meigs that what he calls a &ldquo;silent consideration&rdquo; of one
thousand dollars and some rifles should be given to the chiefs who
signed it.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3211src" href="#xd25e3211" name=
"xd25e3211src">211</a></p>
<p>In 1807 Colonel Elias Earle, with the consent of the Government,
obtained a concession from the Cherokee for the establishment of iron
works at the mouth of Chickamauga creek, on the south side of Tennessee
river, to be supplied from ores mined in the Cherokee country. It was
hoped that this would be a considerable step toward the civilization of
the Indians, besides enabling the Government to obtain its supplies of
manufactured iron at a cheaper rate, but after prolonged effort the
project was finally abandoned on account of the refusal of the state of
Tennessee to sanction the grant.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3216src"
href="#xd25e3216" name="xd25e3216src">212</a> In the same year, by
arrangement with the general government, the legislature of Tennessee
attempted to negotiate with the Cherokee for that part of their unceded
lands lying within the state limits, but without success, owing to the
unwillingness of the Indians to part with any more territory, and their
special dislike for the people of Tennessee.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3219src" href="#xd25e3219" name="xd25e3219src">213</a></p>
<p>In 1810 the Cherokee national council registered a further advance
in civilization by formally abolishing the custom of clan revenge,
hitherto universal among the tribes. The enactment bears the signatures
of Black-fox (Ina&prime;l&#301;), principal chief, and seven others,
and reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first dateline"><span class="sc">In Council,
Oostinaleh</span>, <i>April 18, 1810</i>.</p>
<p>1. Be it known this day, That the various clans or tribes which
compose the Cherokee nation have unanimously passed an act of oblivion
for all lives for which they may have been indebted one to the other,
and have mutually agreed that after this evening the aforesaid act
shall become binding upon every clan or tribe thereof.</p>
<p>2. The aforesaid clans or tribes have also agreed that if, in
future, any life should be lost without malice intended, the innocent
aggressor shall not be accounted guilty; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>and, should it so happen
that a brother, forgetting his natural affections, should raise his
hands in anger and kill his brother, he shall be accounted guilty of
murder and suffer accordingly.</p>
<p>3. If a man have a horse stolen, and overtake the thief, and should
his anger be so great as to cause him to shed his blood, let it remain
on his own conscience, but no satisfaction shall be required for his
life, from his relative or clan he may have belonged to.</p>
<p>By order of the seven clans.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3242src"
href="#xd25e3242" name="xd25e3242src">214</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under an agreement with the Cherokee in 1813 a company composed of
representatives of Tennessee, Georgia, and the Cherokee nation was
organized to lay out a free public road from Tennessee river to the
head of navigation on the Tugaloo branch of Savannah river, with
provision for convenient stopping places along the line. The road was
completed within the next three years, and became the great highway
from the coast to the Tennessee settlements. Beginning on the Tugaloo
or Savannah a short distance below the entrance of Toccoa creek, it
crossed the upper Chattahoochee, passing through Clarkesville,
Nacoochee valley, the Unicoi gap, and Hiwassee in Georgia; then
entering North Carolina it descended the Hiwassee, passing through
Hayesville and Murphy and over the Great Smoky range into Tennessee,
until it reached the terminus at the Cherokee capital, Echota, on
Little Tennessee. It was officially styled the Unicoi
turnpike,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3250src" href="#xd25e3250" name=
"xd25e3250src">215</a> but was commonly known in North Carolina as the
Wachesa trail, from Watsi&prime;sa or Wachesa, a prominent Indian who
lived near the crossing-place on Beaverdam creek, below Murphy, this
portion of the road being laid out along the old Indian trail which
already bore that name.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3253src" href=
"#xd25e3253" name="xd25e3253src">216</a></p>
<p>Passing over for the present some negotiations having for their
purpose the removal of the Cherokee to the West, we arrive at the
period of the Creek war.</p>
<p>Ever since the treaty of Greenville it had been the dream of
Tecumtha, the great Shawano chief (33), to weld again the confederacy
of the northern tribes as a barrier against the further aggressions of
the white man. His own burning eloquence was ably seconded by the
subtler persuasion of his brother, who assumed the role of a prophet
with a new revelation, the burden of which was that the Indians must
return to their old Indian life if they would preserve their national
existence. The new doctrine spread among all the northern tribes and at
last reached those of the south, where Tecumtha himself had gone to
enlist the warriors in the great Indian confederacy. The prophets of
the Upper Creeks eagerly accepted the doctrine and in a short time
their warriors were dancing the &ldquo;dance of the Indians of the
lakes.&rdquo; In <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>anticipation of an expected war with the United
States the British agents in Canada had been encouraging the hostile
feeling toward the Americans by talks and presents of goods and
ammunition, while the Spaniards also covertly fanned the flame of
discontent.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3262src" href="#xd25e3262" name=
"xd25e3262src">217</a> At the height of the ferment war was declared
between this country and England on June 28, 1812. Tecumtha, at the
head of fifteen hundred warriors, at once entered the British service
with a commission as general, while the Creeks began murdering and
burning along the southern frontier, after having vainly attempted to
secure the cooperation of the Cherokee.</p>
<p>From the Creeks the new revelation was brought to the Cherokee,
whose priests at once began to dream dreams and to preach a return to
the old life as the only hope of the Indian race. A great medicine
dance was appointed at Ustanali, the national capital, where, after the
dance was over, the doctrine was publicly announced and explained by a
Cherokee prophet introduced by a delegation from Coosawatee. He began
by saying that some of the mountain towns had abused him and refused to
receive his message, but nevertheless he must continue to bear
testimony of his mission whatever might happen. The Cherokee had broken
the road which had been given to their fathers at the beginning of the
world. They had taken the white man&rsquo;s clothes and trinkets, they
had beds and tables and mills; some even had books and cats. All this
was bad, and because of it their gods were angry and the game was
leaving their country. If they would live and be happy as before they
must put off the white man&rsquo;s dress, throw away his mills and
looms, kill their cats, put on paint and buckskin, and be Indians
again; otherwise swift destruction would come upon them.</p>
<p>His speech appealed strongly to the people, who cried out in great
excitement that his talk was good. Of all those present only Major
Ridge, a principal chief, had the courage to stand up and oppose it,
warning his hearers that such talk would inevitably lead to war with
the United States, which would end in their own destruction. The
maddened followers of the prophet sprang upon Ridge and would have
killed him but for the interposition of friends. As it was, he was
thrown down and narrowly escaped with his life, while one of his
defenders was stabbed by his side.</p>
<p>The prophet had threatened after a certain time to invoke a terrible
storm, which should destroy all but the true believers, who were
exhorted to gather for safety on one of the high peaks of the Great
Smoky mountains. In full faith they abandoned their bees, their
orchards, their slaves, and everything that had come to them from the
white man, and took up their toilsome march for the high mountains.
There they waited until the appointed day had come and passed, showing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>their hopes and fears to be groundless, when they
sadly returned to their homes and the great Indian revival among the
Cherokee came to an end.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3273src" href=
"#xd25e3273" name="xd25e3273src">218</a></p>
<p>Among the Creeks, where other hostile influences were at work, the
excitement culminated in the Creek war. Several murders and outrages
had already been committed, but it was not until the terrible massacre
at Fort Mims (34), on August 30, 1813, that the whole American nation
was aroused. Through the influence of Ridge and other prominent chiefs
the Cherokee had refused to join the hostile Creeks, and on the
contrary had promised to assist the whites and the friendly
towns.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3281src" href="#xd25e3281" name=
"xd25e3281src">219</a> More than a year before the council had sent a
friendly letter to the Creeks warning them against taking the British
side in the approaching war, while several prominent chiefs had
proposed to enlist a Cherokee force for the service of the United
States.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3287src" href="#xd25e3287" name=
"xd25e3287src">220</a> Finding that no help, was to be expected from
the Cherokee, the Creeks took occasion to kill a Cherokee woman near
the town of Etowah, in Georgia. With the help of a conjurer the
murderers were trailed and overtaken and killed on the evening of the
second day in a thicket where they had concealed themselves. After this
there could be no alliance between the two tribes.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e3290src" href="#xd25e3290" name="xd25e3290src">221</a></p>
<p>At the time of the Fort Mims massacre McIntosh (35), the chief of
the friendly Lower Creeks, was visiting the Cherokee, among whom he had
relatives. By order of the Cherokee council he was escorted home by a
delegation under the leadership of Ridge. On his return Ridge brought
with him a request from the Lower Creeks that the Cherokee would join
with them and the Americans in putting down the war. Ridge himself
strongly urged the proposition, declaring that if the prophets were
allowed to have their way the work of civilization would be destroyed.
The council, however, decided not to interfere in the affairs of other
tribes, whereupon Ridge called for volunteers, with the result that so
many of the warriors responded that the council reversed its decision
and declared war against the Creeks.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3296src" href="#xd25e3296" name="xd25e3296src">222</a> For a
proper understanding of the situation it is necessary to state that the
hostile feeling was confined almost entirely to the Upper Creek towns
on the Tallapoosa, where the prophets of the new religion had their
residence. The half-breed chief, Weatherford (36), was the leader of
the war party. The Lower Creek towns on the Chattahoochee, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>under
McIntosh, another half-breed chief, were friendly, and acted with the
Cherokee and the Americans against their own brethren.</p>
<p>It is not our purpose to give a history of the Creek war, but only
to note the part which the Cherokee had in it. The friendly Lower
Creeks, under McIntosh, with a few refugees from the Upper towns,
operated chiefly with the army under General Floyd which invaded the
southern part of the Creek country from Georgia. Some friendly Choctaw
and Chickasaw also lent their assistance in this direction. The
Cherokee, with some friendly Creeks of the Upper towns, acted with the
armies under Generals White and Jackson, which entered the Creek
country from the Tennessee side. While some hundreds of their warriors
were thus fighting in the field, the Cherokee at home were busily
collecting provisions for the American troops.</p>
<p>As Jackson approached from the north, about the end of October,
1813, he was met by runners asking him to come to the aid of
Pathkiller, a Cherokee chief, who was in danger of being cut off by the
hostiles, at his village of Turkeytown, on the upper Coosa, near the
present Center, Alabama. A fresh detachment on its way from east
Tennessee, under General White, was ordered by Jackson to relieve the
town, and successfully performed this work. White&rsquo;s force
consisted of one thousand men, including four hundred Cherokee under
Colonel Gideon Morgan and John Lowrey.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3308src" href="#xd25e3308" name="xd25e3308src">223</a></p>
<p>As the army advanced down the Coosa the Creeks retired to
Tallaseehatchee, on the creek of the same name, near the present
Jacksonville, Calhoun county, Alabama. One thousand men under General
Coffee, together with a company of Cherokee under Captain Richard Brown
and some few Creeks, were sent against them. The Indian auxiliaries
wore headdresses of white feathers and deertails. The attack was made
at daybreak of November 3, 1813, and the town was taken after a
desperate resistance, from which not one of the defenders escaped
alive, the Creeks having been completely surrounded on all sides. Says
Coffee in his official report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">They made all the resistance that an overpowered
soldier could do&mdash;they fought as long as one existed, but their
destruction was very soon completed. Our men rushed up to the doors of
the houses and in a few minutes killed the last warrior of them. The
enemy fought with savage fury and met death with all its horrors,
without shrinking or complaining&mdash;not one asked to be spared, but
fought as long as they could stand or sit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of such fighting stuff did the Creeks prove themselves, against
overwhelming numbers, throughout the war. The bodies of nearly two
hundred dead warriors were counted on the field, and the general
reiterates that &ldquo;not one of the warriors escaped.&rdquo; A number
of women and children were taken prisoners. Nearly every man of the
Creeks had a bow with a bundle of arrows, which he used after the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>first fire with his gun. The American loss was
only five killed and forty-one wounded, which may not include the
Indian contingent.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3321src" href=
"#xd25e3321" name="xd25e3321src">224</a></p>
<p>White&rsquo;s advance guard, consisting chiefly of the four hundred
other Cherokee under Morgan and Lowrey, reached Tallaseehatchee the
same evening, only to find it already destroyed. They picked up twenty
wounded Creeks, whom they brought with them to Turkeytown.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3326src" href="#xd25e3326" name=
"xd25e3326src">225</a></p>
<p>The next great battle was at Talladega, on the site of the present
town of the same name, in Talladega county, Alabama, on November 9,
1813. Jackson commanded in person with two thousand infantry and
cavalry. Although the Cherokee are not specifically mentioned they were
a part of the army and must have taken part in the engagement. The town
itself was occupied by friendly Creeks, who were besieged by the
hostiles, estimated at over one thousand warriors on the outside. Here
again the battle was simply a slaughter, the odds being two to one, the
Creeks being also without cover, although they fought so desperately
that at one time the militia was driven back. They left two hundred and
ninety-nine dead bodies on the field, which, according to their own
statement afterwards, was only a part of their total loss. The
Americans lost fifteen killed and eighty-five wounded.<a class=

<p>A day or two later the people of Hillabee town, about the site of
the present village of that name in Clay county, Alabama, sent
messengers to Jackson&rsquo;s camp to ask for peace, which that
commander immediately granted. In the meantime, even while the peace
messengers were on their way home with the good news, an army of one
thousand men from east Tennessee under General White, who claimed to be
independent of Jackson&rsquo;s authority, together with four hundred
Cherokee under Colonel Gideon Morgan and John Lowrey, surrounded the
town on November 18, 1813, taking it by surprise, the inhabitants
having trusted so confidently to the success of their peace embassy
that they had made no preparation for defense. Sixty warriors were
killed and over two hundred and fifty prisoners taken, with no loss to
the Americans, as there was practically no resistance. In White&rsquo;s
official report of the affair he states that he had sent ahead a part
of his force, together with the Cherokee under Morgan, to surround the
town, and adds that &ldquo;Colonel Morgan and the Cherokees under his
command gave undeniable evidence that they merit the employ of their
government.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3336src" href=
"#xd25e3336" name="xd25e3336src">227</a> Not knowing that the attack
had been made without Jackson&rsquo;s sanction or knowledge, the Creeks
naturally concluded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92"
name="pb92">92</a>]</span>that peace overtures were of no avail, and
thenceforth until the close of the war there was no talk of
surrender.</p>
<p>On November 29, 1813, the Georgia army under General Floyd,
consisting of nine hundred and fifty American troops and four hundred
friendly Indians, chiefly Lower Creeks under McIntosh, took and
destroyed Autossee town on the Tallapoosa, west of the present
Tuskegee, killing about two hundred warriors and burning four hundred
well-built houses. On December 23 the Creeks were again defeated by
General Claiborne, assisted by some friendly Choctaws, at Ecanachaca or
the Holy Ground on Alabama river, near the present Benton in Lowndes
county. This town and another a few miles away were also destroyed,
with a great quantity of provisions and other property.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3343src" href="#xd25e3343" name=
"xd25e3343src">228</a> It is doubtful if any Cherokee were concerned in
either action.</p>
<p>Before the close of the year Jackson&rsquo;s force in northern
Alabama had been so far reduced by mutinies and expiration of service
terms that he had but one hundred soldiers left and was obliged to
employ the Cherokee to garrison Fort Armstrong, on the upper Coosa, and
to protect his provision depot.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3348src"
href="#xd25e3348" name="xd25e3348src">229</a> With the opening of the
new year, 1814, having received reinforcements from Tennessee, together
with about two hundred friendly Creeks and sixty-five more Cherokee, he
left his camp on the Coosa and advanced against the towns on the
Tallapoosa. Learning, on arriving near the river, that he was within a
few miles of the main body of the enemy, he halted for a reconnoissance
and camped in order of battle on Emukfaw creek, on the northern bank of
the Tallapoosa, only a short distance from the famous Horseshoe bend.
Here, on the morning of June 24, 1814, he was suddenly attacked by the
enemy with such fury that, although the troops charged with the
bayonet, the Creeks returned again to the fight and were at last broken
only by the help of the friendly Indians, who came upon them from the
rear. As it was, Jackson was so badly crippled that he retreated to
Fort Strother on the Coosa, carrying his wounded, among them General
Coffee, on horse-hide litters. The Creeks pursued and attacked him
again as he was crossing Enotochopco creek on January 24, but after a
severe fight were driven back with discharges of grapeshot from a
six-pounder at close range. The army then continued its retreat to Fort
Strother. The American loss in these two battles was about one hundred
killed and wounded. The loss of the Creeks was much greater, but they
had compelled a superior force, armed with bayonet and artillery, to
retreat, and without the aid of the friendly Indians it is doubtful if
Jackson could have saved his army from demoralization. The Creeks
themselves claimed a victory and boasted afterward that they had
&ldquo;whipped Jackson and run him to the Coosa river.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>Pickett states, on what seems good authority, that
the Creeks engaged did not number more than five hundred warriors.
Jackson had probably at least one thousand two hundred men, including
Indians.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3353src" href="#xd25e3353" name=
"xd25e3353src">230</a></p>
<p>While these events were transpiring in the north, General Floyd
again advanced from Georgia with a force of about one thousand three
hundred Americans and four hundred friendly Indians, but was surprised
on Caleebee creek, near the present Tuskegee, Alabama, on the morning
of January 27, 1814, and compelled to retreat, leaving the enemy in
possession of the field.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3361src" href=
"#xd25e3361" name="xd25e3361src">231</a></p>
<p>We come now to the final event of the Creek war, the terrible battle
of the Horseshoe bend. Having received large reenforcements from
Tennessee, Jackson left a garrison at Fort Strother, and, about the
middle of March, descended the Coosa river to the mouth of Cedar creek,
southeast from the present Columbiana, where he built Fort Williams.
Leaving his stores here with a garrison to protect them, he began his
march for the Horseshoe bend of the Tallapoosa, where the hostiles were
reported to have collected in great force. At this place, known to the
Creeks as Tohopki or Tohopeka, the Tallapoosa made a bend so as to
inclose some eighty or a hundred acres in a narrow peninsula opening to
the north. On the lower side was an island in the river, and about a
mile below was Emukfaw creek, entering from the north, where Jackson
had been driven back two months before. Both locations were in the
present Tallapoosa county, Alabama, within two miles of the present
post village of Tohopeka. Across the neck of the peninsula the Creeks
had built a strong breastwork of logs, behind which were their houses,
and behind these were a number of canoes moored to the bank for use if
retreat became necessary. The fort was defended by a thousand warriors,
with whom were also about three hundred women and children.
Jackson&rsquo;s force numbered about two thousand men, including,
according to his own statement, five hundred Cherokee. He had also two
small cannon. The account of the battle, or rather massacre, which
occurred on the morning of March 27, 1814, is best condensed from the
official reports of the principal commanders.</p>
<p>Having arrived in the neighborhood of the fort, Jackson disposed his
men for the attack by detailing General Coffee with the mounted men and
nearly the whole of the Indian force to cross the river at a ford about
three miles below and surround the bend in such manner that none could
escape in that direction. He himself, with the rest of his force,
advanced to the front of the breastwork and planted his cannon
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>upon a slight rise within eighty yards of the
fortification. He then directed a heavy cannonade upon the center of
the breastwork, while the rifles and muskets kept up a galling fire
upon the defenders whenever they showed themselves behind the logs. The
breastwork was very strongly and compactly built, from five to eight
feet high, with a double row of portholes, and so planned that no enemy
could approach without being exposed to a crossfire from those on the
inside. After about two hours of cannonading and rifle fire to no great
purpose, &ldquo;Captain Russell&rsquo;s company of spies and a party of
the Cherokee force, headed by their gallant chieftain, Colonel Richard
Brown, and conducted by the brave Colonel Morgan, crossed over to the
peninsula in canoes and set fire to a few of their buildings there
situated. They then advanced with great gallantry toward the breastwork
and commenced firing upon the enemy, who lay behind it. Finding that
this force, notwithstanding the determination they displayed, was
wholly insufficient to dislodge the enemy, and that General Coffee had
secured the opposite banks of the river, I now determined on taking
possession of their works by storm.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3371src" href="#xd25e3371" name="xd25e3371src">232</a></p>
<p>Coffee&rsquo;s official report to his commanding officer states that
he had taken seven hundred mounted troops and about six hundred
Indians, of whom five hundred were Cherokee and the rest friendly
Creeks, and had come in behind, having directed the Indians to take
position secretly along the bank of the river to prevent the enemy
crossing, as already noted. This was done, but with fighting going on
so near at hand the Indians could not remain quiet. Continuing, Coffee
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The firing of your cannon and small arms in a short
time became general and heavy, which animated our Indians, and seeing
about one hundred of the warriors and all the squaws and children of
the enemy running about among the huts of the village, which was open
to our view, they could no longer remain silent spectators. While some
kept up a fire across the river to prevent the enemy&rsquo;s approach
to the bank, others plunged into the water and swam the river for
canoes that lay at the other shore in considerable numbers and brought
them over, in which crafts a number of them embarked and landed on the
bend with the enemy. Colonel Gideon Morgan, who commanded the
Cherokees, Captain Kerr, and Captain William Russell, with a part of
his company of spies, were among the first that crossed the river. They
advanced into the village and very soon drove the enemy from the huts
up the river bank to the fortified works from which they were fighting
you. They pursued and continued to annoy during your whole action. This
movement of my Indian forces left the river bank unguarded and made it
necessary that I should send a part of my line to take possession of
the river bank.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3379src" href="#xd25e3379"
name="xd25e3379src">233</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the official report of Colonel Morgan, who commanded
the Cherokee and who was himself severely wounded, the Cherokee took
the places assigned them along the bank in such regular order
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>that no part was left unoccupied, and the few
fugitives who attempted to escape from the fort by water &ldquo;fell an
easy prey to their vengeance.&rdquo; Finally, seeing that the cannonade
had no more effect upon the breastwork than to bore holes in the logs,
some of the Cherokee plunged into the river, and swimming over to the
town brought back a number of canoes. A part crossed in these, under
cover of the guns of their companions, and sheltered themselves under
the bank while the canoes were sent back for reenforcements. In this
way they all crossed over and then advanced up the bank, where at once
they were warmly assailed from every side except the rear, which they
kept open only by hard fighting.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3386src"
href="#xd25e3386" name="xd25e3386src">234</a></p>
<p>The Creeks had been fighting the Americans in their front at such
close quarters that their bullets flattened upon the bayonets thrust
through the portholes. This attack from the rear by five hundred
Cherokee diverted their attention and gave opportunity to the
Tennesseeans, Sam Houston among them, cheering them on, to swarm over
the breastwork. With death from the bullet, the bayonet and the hatchet
all around them, and the smoke of their blazing homes in their eyes,
not a warrior begged for his life. When more than half their number lay
dead upon the ground, the rest turned and plunged into the river, only
to find the banks on the opposite side lined with enemies and escape
cut off in every direction. Says General Coffee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Attempts to cross the river at all points of the bend
were made by the enemy, but not one ever escaped. Very few ever reached
the bank and that few was killed the instant they landed. From the
report of my officers, as well as from my own observation, I feel
warranted in saying that from two hundred and fifty to three hundred of
the enemy was buried under water and was not numbered with the dead
that were found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some swam for the island below the bend, but here too a detachment
had been posted and &ldquo;not one ever landed. They were sunk by
Lieutenant Bean&rsquo;s command ere they reached the
bank.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3397src" href="#xd25e3397"
name="xd25e3397src">235</a></p>
<p>Quoting again from Jackson&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The enemy, although many of them fought to the last
with that kind of bravery which desperation inspires, were at last
entirely routed and cut to pieces. The battle may be said to have
continued with severity for about five hours, but the firing and
slaughter continued until it was suspended by the darkness of night.
The next morning it was resumed and sixteen of the enemy slain who had
concealed themselves under the banks.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3405src" href="#xd25e3405" name="xd25e3405src">236</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was supposed that the Creeks had about a thousand warriors,
besides their women and children. The men sent out to count the dead
found five hundred and fifty-seven warriors lying dead within the
inclosure, and Coffee estimates that from two hundred and fifty to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>three hundred were shot in the water. How many
more there may have been can not be known, but Jackson himself states
that not more than twenty could have escaped. There is no mention of
any wounded. About three hundred prisoners were taken, of whom only
three were men. The defenders of the Horseshoe had been
exterminated.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3412src" href="#xd25e3412"
name="xd25e3412src">237</a></p>
<p>On the other side the loss was 26 Americans killed and 107 wounded,
18 Cherokee killed and 36 wounded, 5 friendly Creeks killed and 11
wounded. It will be noted that the loss of the Cherokee was out of all
proportion to their numbers, their fighting having been hand to hand
work without protecting cover. In view of the fact that Jackson had
only a few weeks before been compelled to retreat before this same
enemy, and that two hours of artillery and rifle fire had produced no
result until the Cherokee turned the rear of the enemy by their daring
passage of the river, there is considerable truth in the boast of the
Cherokee that they saved the day for Jackson at Horseshoe bend. In the
number of men actually engaged and the immense proportion killed, this
ranks as the greatest Indian battle in the history of the United
States, with the possible exception of the battle of Mauvila, fought by
the same Indians in De Soto&rsquo;s time. The result was decisive. Two
weeks later Weatherford came in and surrendered, and the Creek war was
at an end.</p>
<p>As is usual where Indians have acted as auxiliaries of white troops,
it is difficult to get an accurate statement of the number of Cherokee
engaged in this war or to apportion the credit among the various
leaders. Coffee&rsquo;s official report states that five hundred
Cherokee were engaged in the last great battle, and from incidental
hints it seems probable that others were employed elsewhere, on
garrison duty or otherwise, at the same time. McKenney and Hall state
that Ridge recruited eight hundred warriors for Jackson,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3419src" href="#xd25e3419" name=
"xd25e3419src">238</a> and this may be near the truth, as the tribe had
then at least six times as many fighting men. On account of the general
looseness of Indian organization we commonly find the credit claimed
for whichever chief may be best known to the chronicler. Thus, McKenney
and Hall make Major Ridge the hero of the war, especially of the
Horseshoe fight, although he is not mentioned in the official reports.
Jackson speaks particularly of the Cherokee in that battle as being
&ldquo;headed by their gallant chieftain, Colonel Richard Brown, and
conducted by the brave Colonel Morgan.&rdquo; Coffee says that Colonel
Gideon Morgan &ldquo;commanded the Cherokees,&rdquo; and it is Morgan
who makes the official report of their part in the battle. In a
Washington newspaper notice of the treaty <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>delegation of 1816 the
six signers are mentioned as Colonel [John] Lowrey, Major [John]
Walker, Major Ridge, Captain [Richard] Taylor, Adjutant [John] Ross,
and Kunnesee (Tsi&prime;yu-g&ucirc;nsi&prime;n&#301;, Cheucunsene) and
are described as men of cultivation, nearly all of whom had served as
officers of the Cherokee forces with Jackson and distinguished
themselves as well by their bravery as by their attachment to the
United States.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3424src" href="#xd25e3424"
name="xd25e3424src">239</a> Among the East Cherokee in Carolina the
only name still remembered is that of their old chief, Junaluska
(Tsunu&prime;lahu&ntilde;&prime;sk&#301;), who said afterward:
&ldquo;If I had known that Jackson would drive us from our homes I
would have killed him that day at the Horseshoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cherokee returned to their homes to find them despoiled and
ravaged in their absence by disorderly white troops. Two years
afterward, by treaty at Washington, the Government agreed to reimburse
them for the damage. Interested parties denied that they had suffered
any damage or rendered any services, to which their agent indignantly
replied: &ldquo;It may be answered that thousands witnessed both; that
in nearly all the battles with the Creeks the Cherokees rendered the
most efficient service, and at the expense of the lives of many fine
men, whose wives and children and brothers and sisters are mourning
their fall.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3429src" href=
"#xd25e3429" name="xd25e3429src">240</a></p>
<p>In the spring of 1816 a delegation of seven principal men,
accompanied by Agent Meigs, visited Washington, and the result was the
negotiation of two treaties at that place on the same date, March 22,
1816. By the first of these the Cherokee ceded for five thousand
dollars their last remaining territory in South Carolina, a small strip
in the extreme northwestern corner, adjoining Chattooga river. By the
second treaty a boundary was established between the lands claimed by
the Cherokee and Creeks in northern Alabama. This action was made
necessary in order to determine the boundaries of the great tract which
the Creeks had been compelled to surrender in punishment for their late
uprising. The line was run from a point on Little Bear creek in
northwestern Alabama direct to the Ten islands of the Coosa at old Fort
Strother, southeast of the present Asheville. General Jackson protested
strongly against this line, on the ground that all the territory south
of Tennessee river and west of the Coosa belonged to the Creeks and was
a part of their cession. The Chickasaw also protested against
considering this tract as Cherokee territory. The treaty also granted
free and unrestricted road privileges throughout the Cherokee country,
this concession being the result of years of persistent effort on the
part of the Government; and an appropriation of twenty-five thousand
five hundred dollars was made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href=
"#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>for damages sustained by the Cherokee
from the depredations of the troops passing through their country
during the Creek war.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3440src" href=
"#xd25e3440" name="xd25e3440src">241</a></p>
<p>At the last treaty the Cherokee had resisted every effort to induce
them to cede more land on either side of the Tennessee, the Government
being especially desirous to extinguish their claim north of that river
within the limits of the state of Tennessee. Failing in this, pressure
was at once begun to bring about a cession in Alabama, with the result
that on September 14 of the same year a treaty was concluded at the
Chickasaw council-house, and afterward ratified in general council at
Turkeytown on the Coosa, by which the Cherokee ceded all their claims
in that state south of Tennessee river and west of an irregular line
running from Chickasaw island in that stream, below the entrance of
Flint river, to the junction of Wills creek with the Coosa, at the
present Gadsden. For this cession, embracing an area of nearly three
thousand five hundred square miles, they were to receive sixty thousand
dollars in ten annual payments, together with five thousand dollars for
the improvements abandoned.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3445src" href=
"#xd25e3445" name="xd25e3445src">242</a></p>
<p>We turn aside now for a time from the direct narrative to note the
development of events which culminated in the forced expatriation of
the Cherokee from their ancestral homes and their removal to the far
western wilderness.</p>
<p>With a few notable exceptions the relations between the French and
Spanish colonists and the native tribes, after the first occupation of
the country, had been friendly and agreeable. Under the rule of France
or Spain there was never any Indian boundary. Pioneer and Indian built
their cabins and tilled their fields side by side, ranged the woods
together, knelt before the same altar and frequently intermarried on
terms of equality, so far as race was concerned. The result is seen
to-day in the mixed-blood communities of Canada, and in Mexico, where a
nation has been built upon an Indian foundation. Within the area of
English colonization it was otherwise. From the first settlement to the
recent inauguration of the allotment system it never occurred to the
man of Teutonic blood that he could have for a neighbor anyone not of
his own stock and color. While the English colonists recognized the
native proprietorship so far as to make treaties with the Indians, it
was chiefly for the purpose of fixing limits beyond which the Indian
should never come after he had once parted with his title for a
consideration of goods and trinkets. In an early Virginia treaty it was
even stipulated that friendly Indians crossing the line should suffer
death. The Indian was regarded as an incumbrance to be cleared off,
like the trees and the wolves, before white men could live in the
country. Intermarriages were practically <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>unknown, and the children
of such union were usually compelled by race antipathy to cast their
lot with the savage.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances the tribes viewed the advance of the
English and their successors, the Americans, with keen distrust, and as
early as the close of the French and Indian war we find some of them
removing from the neighborhood of the English settlements to a safer
shelter in the more remote territories still held by Spain. Soon after
the French withdrew from Fort Toulouse, in 1763, a part of the Alabama,
an incorporated tribe of the Creek confederacy, left their villages on
the Coosa, and crossing the Mississippi, where they halted for a time
on its western bank, settled on the Sabine river under Spanish
protection.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3456src" href="#xd25e3456" name=
"xd25e3456src">243</a> They were followed some years later by a part of
the Koasati, of the same confederacy,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3462src" href="#xd25e3462" name="xd25e3462src">244</a> the two
tribes subsequently drifting into Texas, where they now reside. The
Hichitee and others of the Lower Creeks moved down into Spanish
Florida, where the Yamassee exiles from South Carolina had long before
preceded them, the two combining to form the modern Seminole tribe.
When the Revolution brought about a new line of division, the native
tribes, almost without exception, joined sides with England as against
the Americans, with the result that about one-half the Iroquois fled to
Canada, where they still reside upon lands granted by the British
government. A short time before Wayne&rsquo;s victory a part of the
Shawano and Delawares, worn out by nearly twenty years of battle with
the Americans, crossed the Mississippi and settled, by permission of
the Spanish government, upon lands in the vicinity of Cape Girardeau,
in what is now southeastern Missouri, for which they obtained a regular
deed from that government in 1793.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3465src"
href="#xd25e3465" name="xd25e3465src">245</a> Driven out by the
Americans some twenty years later, they removed to Kansas and thence to
Indian territory, where they are now incorporated with their old
friends, the Cherokee.</p>
<p>When the first Cherokee crossed the Mississippi it is impossible to
say, but there was probably never a time in the history of the tribe
when their warriors and hunters were not accustomed to make excursions
beyond the great river. According to an old tradition, the earliest
emigration took place soon after the first treaty with Carolina, when a
portion of the tribe, under the leadership of
Y&ucirc;&ntilde;w&#301;-usga&prime;s&#277;&#699;t&#301;,
&ldquo;Dangerous-man,&rdquo; <span class="corr" id="xd25e3470" title=
"Source: forseeing">foreseeing</span> the inevitable end of yielding to
the demands of the colonists, refused to have any relations with the
white man, and took up their long march for the unknown West.
Communication was kept up with the home body until after crossing the
Mississippi, when they were lost sight of and forgotten. Long years
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>afterward a rumor came from the west that they
were still living near the base of the Rocky mountains.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3475src" href="#xd25e3475" name=
"xd25e3475src">246</a> In 1782 the Cherokee, who had fought faithfully
on the British side throughout the long Revolutionary struggle, applied
to the Spanish governor at New Orleans for permission to settle on the
west side of the Mississippi, within Spanish territory. Permission was
granted, and it is probable that some of them removed to the Arkansas
country, although there seems to be no definite record of the
matter.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3481src" href="#xd25e3481" name=
"xd25e3481src">247</a> We learn incidentally, however, that about this
<span class="corr" id="xd25e3487" title="Source: peried">period</span>
the hostile Cherokee, like the Shawano and other northern tribes, were
in the habit of making friendly visits to the Spanish settlements in
that quarter.</p>
<p>According to Reverend Cephas Washburn, the pioneer <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e3492" title="Source: misssionary">missionary</span> of
the western Cherokee, the first permanent Cherokee settlement beyond
the Mississippi was the direct result of the massacre, in 1794, of the
Scott party at Muscle shoals, on Tennessee river, by the hostile
warriors of the Chickamauga towns, in the summer. As told by the
missionary, the story differs considerably from that given by Haywood
and other Tennessee historians, narrated in another place.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3495src" href="#xd25e3495" name=
"xd25e3495src">248</a> According to Washburn, the whites were the
aggressors, having first made the Indians drunk and then swindled them
out of the annuity money with which they were just returning from the
agency at Tellico. When the Indians became sober enough to demand the
return of their money the whites attacked and killed two of them,
whereupon the others boarded the boat and killed every white man. They
spared the women and children, however, with their negro slaves and all
their personal belongings, and permitted them to continue on their way,
the chief and his party personally escorting them down Tennessee, Ohio,
and Mississippi rivers as far as the mouth of the St. Francis, whence
the emigrants descended in safety to New Orleans, while their captors,
under their chief, The Bowl, went up St. Francis river&mdash;then a
part of Spanish territory&mdash;to await the outcome of the event. As
soon as the news came to the Cherokee Nation the chiefs formally
repudiated the action of the Bowl party and volunteered to assist in
arresting those concerned. Bowl and his men were finally exonerated,
but had conceived such bitterness at the conduct of their former
friends, and, moreover, had found the soil so rich and the game so
abundant where they were, that they refused to return to their tribe
and decided to remain permanently in the West. Others joined them from
time to time, attracted by the hunting prospect, until they were in
sufficient number to obtain recognition from the Government.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3498src" href="#xd25e3498" name=

<p>While the missionary may be pardoned for making the best showing
possible for his friends, his statement contains several evident
errors, and it is probable that Haywood&rsquo;s account is more correct
in the main. As the Cherokee annuity at that time amounted to but
fifteen hundred dollars for the whole tribe, or somewhat less than ten
cents per head, they could hardly have had enough money from that
source to pay such extravagant prices as sixteen dollars apiece for
pocket-mirrors, which it is alleged the boatmen obtained. Moreover, as
the Chickamauga warriors had refused to sign any treaties and were
notoriously hostile, they were not as yet entitled to receive payments.
Haywood&rsquo;s statement that the emigrant party was first attacked
while passing the Chickamauga towns and then pursued to the Muscle
shoals and there massacred is probably near the truth, although it is
quite possible that the whites may have provoked the attack in some
such way as is indicated by the missionary. As Washburn got his account
from one of the women of the party, living long afterward in New
Orleans, it is certain that some at least were spared by the Indians,
and it is probable that, as he states, only the men were killed.</p>
<p>The Bowl emigration may not have been the first, or even the most
important removal to the western country, as the period was one of
Indian unrest. Small bands were constantly crossing the Mississippi
into Spanish territory to avoid the advancing Americans, only to find
themselves again under American jurisdiction when the whole western
country was ceded to the United States in 1803. The persistent
land-hunger of the settler could not be restrained or satisfied, and
early in the same year President Jefferson suggested to Congress the
desirability of removing all the tribes to the west of the Mississippi.
In the next year, 1804, an appropriation was made for taking
preliminary steps toward such a result.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3506src" href="#xd25e3506" name="xd25e3506src">250</a> There were
probably but few Cherokee on the Arkansas at this time, as they are not
mentioned in Sibley&rsquo;s list of tribes south of that river in
1805.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1808, a Cherokee delegation being about to visit
Washington, their agent, Colonel Meigs, was instructed by the Secretary
of War to use every effort to obtain their consent to an exchange of
their lands for a tract beyond the Mississippi. By this time the
government&rsquo;s civilizing policy, as carried out in the annual
distribution of farming tools, spinning wheels, and looms, had wrought
a considerable difference of habit and sentiment between the northern
and southern Cherokee. Those on Little Tennessee and Hiwassee were
generally farmers and stock raisers, producing also a limited quantity
of cotton, which the women wove into cloth. Those farther down in
Georgia and Alabama, the old hostile element, still preferred the
hunting life and rejected all effort at innovation, although the game
had now become so scarce that it was evident a change must soon
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>come. Jealousies had arisen in consequence, and
the delegates representing the progressive element now proposed to the
government that a line be run through the nation to separate the two
parties, allowing those on the north to divide their lands in severalty
and become citizens of the United States, while those on the south
might continue to be hunters as long as the game should last. Taking
advantage of this condition of affairs, the government authorities
instructed the agent to submit to the conservatives a proposition for a
cession of their share of the tribal territory in return for a tract
west of the Mississippi of sufficient area to enable them to continue
the hunting life. The plan was approved by President Jefferson, and a
sum was appropriated to pay the expenses of a delegation to visit and
inspect the lands on Arkansas and White rivers, with a view to removal.
The visit was made in the summer of 1809, and the delegates brought
back such favorable report that a large number of Cherokee signified
their intention to remove at once. As no funds were then available for
their removal, the matter was held in abeyance for several years,
during which period families and individuals removed to the western
country at their own expense until, before the year 1817, they numbered
in all two or three thousand souls.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3513src"
href="#xd25e3513" name="xd25e3513src">251</a> They became known as the
Arkansas, or Western, Cherokee.</p>
<p>The emigrants soon became involved in difficulties with the native
tribes, the Osage claiming all the lands north of Arkansas river, while
the Quapaw claimed those on the south. Upon complaining to the
government the emigrant Cherokee were told that they had originally
been permitted to remove only on condition of a cession of a portion of
their eastern territory, and that nothing could be done to protect them
in their new western home until such cession had been carried out. The
body of the Cherokee Nation, however, was strongly opposed to any such
sale and proposed that the emigrants should be compelled to return.
After protracted negotiation a treaty was concluded at the Cherokee
agency (now Calhoun, Tennessee) on July 8, 1817, by which the Cherokee
Nation ceded two considerable tracts&mdash;the first in Georgia, lying
east of the Chattahoochee, and the other in Tennessee, between Waldens
ridge and the Little Sequatchee&mdash;as an equivalent for a tract to
be assigned to those who had already removed, or intended to remove, to
Arkansas. Two smaller tracts on the north bank of the Tennessee, in the
neighborhood of the Muscle shoals, were also ceded. In return for these
cessions the emigrant Cherokee were to receive a tract within the
present limits of the state of Arkansas, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>bounded on the north
and south by White river and Arkansas river, respectively, on the east
by a line running between those streams approximately from the present
Batesville to Lewisburg, and on the west by a line to be determined
later. As afterward established, this western line ran from the
junction of the Little North Fork with White river to just beyond the
point where the present western Arkansas boundary strikes Arkansas
river. Provision was made for taking the census of the whole Cherokee
nation east and west in order to apportion annuities and other payments
properly in the future, and the two bands were still to be considered
as forming one people. The United States agreed to pay for any
substantial improvements abandoned by those removing from the ceded
lands, and each emigrant warrior who left no such valuable property
behind was to be given as full compensation for his abandoned field and
cabin a rifle and ammunition, a blanket, and a kettle or a beaver trap.
The government further agreed to furnish boats and provisions for the
journey. Provision was also made that individuals residing upon the
ceded lands might retain allotments and become citizens, if they so
elected, the amount of the allotment to be deducted from the total
cession.</p>
<p>The commissioners for the treaty were General Andrew Jackson,
General David Meriwether, and Governor Joseph McMinn of Tennessee. On
behalf of the Cherokee it was signed by thirty-one principal men of the
eastern Nation and fifteen of the western band, who signed by
proxy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3523src" href="#xd25e3523" name=
"xd25e3523src">252</a></p>
<p>The majority of the Cherokee were bitterly opposed to any cession or
removal project, and before the treaty had been concluded a memorial
signed by sixty-seven chiefs and headmen of the nation was presented to
the commissioners, which stated that the delegates who had first
broached the subject in Washington some years before had acted without
any authority from the nation. They declared that the great body of the
Cherokee desired to remain in the land of their birth, where they were
rapidly advancing in civilization, instead of being compelled to revert
to their original savage conditions and surroundings. They therefore
prayed that the matter might not be pressed further, but that they
might be allowed to remain in peaceable possession of the land of their
fathers. No attention was paid to the memorial, and the treaty was
carried through and ratified. Without waiting for the ratification, the
authorities at once took steps for the removal of those who desired to
go to the West. Boats were provided at points between Little Tennessee
and Sequatchee rivers, and the emigrants were collected under the
direction of Governor McMinn. Within the next year a large number had
emigrated, and before the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href=
"#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>end of 1819 the number of
emigrants was said to have increased to six thousand. The chiefs of the
nation, however, claimed that the estimate was greatly in excess of the
truth.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3530src" href="#xd25e3530" name=
"xd25e3530src">253</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no question that a very large portion, and
probably a majority, of the Cherokee nation residing east of the
Mississippi had been and still continued bitterly opposed to the terms
of the treaty of 1817. They viewed with jealous and aching hearts all
attempts to drive them from the homes of their ancestors, for they
could not but consider the constant and urgent importunities of the
federal authorities in the light of an imperative demand for the
cession of more territory. They felt that they were, as a nation, being
slowly but surely compressed within the contracting coils of the giant
anaconda of civilization; yet they held to the vain hope that a spirit
of justice and mercy would be born of their helpless condition which
would finally prevail in their favor. Their traditions furnished them
no guide by which to judge of the results certain to follow such a
conflict as that in which they were engaged. This difference of
sentiment in the nation upon a subject so vital to their welfare was
productive of much bitterness and violent animosities. Those who had
favored the emigration scheme and had been induced, either through
personal preference or by the subsidizing influences of the government
agents, to favor the conclusion of the treaty, became the object of
scorn and hatred to the remainder of the nation. They were made the
subjects of a persecution so relentless, while they remained in the
eastern country, that it was never forgotten, and when, in the natural
course of events, the remainder of the nation was forced to remove to
the Arkansas country and join the earlier emigrants, the old hatreds
and dissensions broke out afresh, and to this day they find lodgment in
some degree in the breasts of their descendants.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3535src" href="#xd25e3535" name=
"xd25e3535src">254</a></p>
<p>Two months after the signing of the treaty of July 8, 1817, and
three months before its ratification, a council of the nation sent a
delegation to Washington to recount in detail the improper methods and
influences which had been used to consummate it, and to ask that it be
set aside and another agreement substituted. The mission was without
result.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3540src" href="#xd25e3540" name=
"xd25e3540src">255</a></p>
<p>In 1817 the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions
established its first station among the Cherokee at Brainerd, in
Tennessee, on the west side of Chickamauga creek, two miles from the
Georgia line. The mission took its name from a distinguished pioneer
worker among the northern tribes (37). The government aided in the
erection of the buildings, which included a schoolhouse, gristmill, and
workshops, in which, besides the ordinary branches, the boys were
taught simple mechanic arts while the girls learned the use of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>needle and the spinningwheel. There was also a
large work farm. The mission prospered and others were established at
Willstown, Hightower, and elsewhere by the same board, in which two
hundred pupils were receiving instruction in 1820.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e3547src" href="#xd25e3547" name="xd25e3547src">256</a> Among
the earliest and most noted workers at the Brainerd mission were
Reverend D. S. Buttrick and Reverend S. A. Worcester (38), the latter
especially having done much for the mental elevation of the Cherokee,
and more than once having suffered imprisonment for his zeal in
defending their cause. The missions flourished until broken up by the
state of Georgia at the beginning of the Removal troubles, and they
were afterwards renewed in the western country. Mission ridge preserves
the memory of the Brainerd establishment.</p>
<p>Early in 1818 a delegation of emigrant Cherokee visited Washington
for the purpose of securing a more satisfactory determination of the
boundaries of their new lands on the Arkansas. Measures were soon
afterward taken for that purpose. They also asked recognition in the
future as a separate and distinct tribe, but nothing was done in the
matter. In order to remove, if possible, the hostile feeling between
the emigrants and the native Osage, who regarded the former as
intruders, Governor William Clark, superintendent of Indian affairs for
Missouri, arranged a conference of the chiefs of the two tribes at St.
Louis in October of that year, at which, after protracted effort, he
succeeded in establishing friendly relations between them. Efforts were
made about the same time, both by the emigrant Cherokee and by the
government, to persuade the Shawano and Delawares then residing in
Missouri, and the Oneida in New York, to join the western Cherokee, but
nothing came of the negotiations.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3555src"
href="#xd25e3555" name="xd25e3555src">257</a> In 1825 a delegation of
western Cherokee visited the Shawano in Ohio for the same purpose, but
without success. Their object in thus inviting friendly Indians to join
them was to strengthen themselves against the Osage and other native
tribes.</p>
<p>In the meantime the government, through Governor McMinn, was
bringing strong pressure to bear upon the eastern Cherokee to compel
their removal to the West. At a council convened by him in November,
1818, the governor represented to the chiefs that it was now no longer
possible to protect them from the encroachments of the surrounding
white population; that, however the government might wish to help them,
their lands would be taken, their stock stolen, their women corrupted,
and their men made drunkards unless they removed to the western
paradise. He ended by proposing to pay them one hundred thousand
dollars for their whole territory, with the expense of removal, if they
would go at once. Upon their prompt and indignant refusal he offered to
double the amount, but with as little success. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>Every point of the negotiation having failed, another course was
adopted, and a delegation was selected to visit Washington under the
conduct of Agent Meigs. Here the effort was renewed until, wearied and
discouraged at the persistent importunity, the chiefs consented to a
large cession, which was represented as necessary in order to
compensate in area for the tract assigned to the emigrant Cherokee in
Arkansas in accordance with the previous treaty. This estimate was
based on the figures given by Governor McMinn, who reported 5,291
Cherokee enrolled as emigrants, while the eastern Cherokee claimed that
not more than 3,500 had removed and that those remaining numbered
12,544, or more than three-fourths of the whole nation. The governor,
however, chose to consider one-half of the nation as in favor of
removal and one-third as having already removed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3563src" href="#xd25e3563" name="xd25e3563src">258</a></p>
<p>The treaty, concluded at Washington on February 27, 1819, recites
that the greater part of the Cherokee nation, having expressed an
earnest desire to remain in the East, and being anxious to begin the
necessary measures for the civilization and preservation of their
nation, and to settle the differences arising out of the treaty of
1817, have offered to cede to the United States a tract of country
&ldquo;at least as extensive&rdquo; as that to which the Government is
entitled under the late treaty. The cession embraces (1) a tract in
Alabama and Tennessee, between Tennessee and Flint rivers; (2) a tract
in Tennessee, between Tennessee river and Waldens ridge; (3) a large
irregular tract in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia, embracing in
Tennessee nearly all the remaining Cherokee lands north of Hiwassee
river, and in North Carolina and Georgia nearly everything remaining to
them east of the Nantahala mountains and the upper western branch of
the Chattahoochee; (4) six small pieces reserved by previous treaties.
The entire cession aggregated nearly six thousand square miles, or more
than one-fourth of all then held by the nation. Individual reservations
of one mile square each within the ceded area were allowed to a number
of families which decided to remain among the whites and become
citizens rather than abandon their homes. Payment was to be made for
all substantial improvements abandoned, one-third of all tribal
annuities were hereafter to be paid to the western band, and the treaty
was declared to be a final adjustment of all claims and differences
arising from the treaty of 1817.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3568src"
href="#xd25e3568" name="xd25e3568src">259</a></p>
<p>Civilization had now progressed so far among the Cherokee that in
the fall of 1820 they adopted a regular republican form of government
modeled after that of the United States. Under this arrangement the
nation was divided into eight districts, each of which was entitled
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>to send four representatives to the Cherokee
national legislature, which met at Newtown, or New Echota, the capital,
at the junction of Conasauga and Coosawatee rivers, a few miles above
the present Calhoun, Georgia. The legislature consisted of an upper and
a lower house, designated, respectively (in the Cherokee language), the
national committee and national council, the members being elected for
limited terms by the voters of each district. The principal officer was
styled president of the national council; the distinguished John Ross
was the first to hold this office. There was also a clerk of the
committee and two principal members to express the will of the council
or lower house. For each district there were appointed a council house
for meetings twice a year, a judge, and a marshal. Companies of
&ldquo;light horse&rdquo; were organized to assist in the execution of
the laws, with a &ldquo;ranger&rdquo; for each district to look after
stray stock. Each head of a family and each single man under the age of
sixty was subject to a poll tax. Laws were passed for the collection of
taxes and debts, for repairs on roads, for licenses to white persons
engaged in farming or other business in the nation, for the support of
schools, for the regulation of the liquor traffic and the conduct of
negro slaves, to punish horse stealing and theft, to compel all
marriages between white men and Indian women to be according to regular
legal or church form, and to discourage polygamy. By special decree the
right of blood revenge or capital punishment was taken from the seven
clans and vested in the constituted authorities of the nation. It was
made treason, punishable with death, for any individual to negotiate
the sale of lands to the whites without the consent of the national
council (39). White men were not allowed to vote or to hold office in
the nation.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3575src" href="#xd25e3575" name=
"xd25e3575src">260</a> The system compared favorably with that of the
Federal government or of any state government then existing.</p>
<p>At this time there were five principal missions, besides one or two
small branch establishments in the nation, viz: Spring Place, the
oldest, founded by the Moravians at Spring place, Georgia, in 1801;
Oothcaloga, Georgia, founded by the same denomination in 1821 on the
creek of that name, near the present Calhoun; Brainerd, Tennessee,
founded by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in
1817; &ldquo;Valley-towns,&rdquo; North Carolina, founded by the
Baptists in 1820, on the site of the old Natchez town on the north side
of Hiwassee river, just above Peachtree creek; Coosawatee, Georgia
(&ldquo;Tensawattee,&rdquo; by error in the State Papers), founded also
by the Baptists in 1821, near the mouth of the river of that name. All
were in flourishing condition, the Brainerd establishment especially,
with nearly one hundred pupils, being obliged to turn away applicants
for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>lack of accommodation. The superintendent
reported that the children were apt to learn, willing to labor, and
readily submissive to discipline, adding that the Cherokee were fast
advancing toward civilized life and generally manifested an ardent
desire for instruction. The Valley-towns mission, established at the
instance of Currahee Dick, a prominent local mixed-blood chief, was in
charge of the Reverend Evan Jones, known as the translator of the New
Testament into the Cherokee language, his assistant being James D.
Wafford, a mixed-blood pupil, who compiled a spelling book in the same
language. Reverend S. A. Worcester, a prolific translator and the
compiler of the Cherokee almanac and other works, was stationed at
Brainerd, removing thence to New Echota and afterward to the Cherokee
Nation in the West.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3588src" href=
"#xd25e3588" name="xd25e3588src">261</a> Since 1817 the American Board
had also supported at Cornwall, Connecticut, an Indian school at which
a number of young Cherokee were being educated, among them being Elias
Boudinot, afterward the editor of the <i>Cherokee Ph&oelig;nix</i>.</p>
<p>About this time occurred an event which at once placed the Cherokee
in the front rank among native tribes and was destined to have profound
influence on their whole future history, viz., the invention of the
alphabet.</p>
<p>The inventor, aptly called the Cadmus of his race, was a mixed-blood
known among his own people as Sikw&acirc;&prime;y&#301; (Sequoya) and
among the whites as George Gist, or less correctly Guest or Guess. As
is usually the case in Indian biography much uncertainty exists in
regard to his parentage and early life. Authorities generally agree
that his father was a white man, who drifted into the Cherokee Nation
some years before the Revolution and formed a temporary alliance with a
Cherokee girl of mixed blood, who thus became the mother of the future
teacher. A writer in the <i>Cherokee Ph&oelig;nix</i>, in 1828, says
that only his paternal grandfather was a white man.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e3605src" href="#xd25e3605" name="xd25e3605src">262</a>
McKenney and Hall say that his father was a white man named
Gist.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3608src" href="#xd25e3608" name=
"xd25e3608src">263</a> Phillips asserts that his father was George
Gist, an unlicensed German trader from Georgia, who came into the
Cherokee Nation in 1768.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3614src" href=
"#xd25e3614" name="xd25e3614src">264</a> By a Kentucky family it is
claimed that Sequoya&rsquo;s father was Nathaniel Gist, son of the
scout who accompanied Washington on his memorable excursion to the
Ohio. As the story goes, Nathaniel Gist was captured by the Cherokee at
Braddock&rsquo;s defeat (1755) and remained a prisoner with them for
six years, during which time he became the father of Sequoya. On his
return to civilization he married a white woman in Virginia, by whom he
had other children, and afterward <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109"
href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>removed to Kentucky, where
Sequoya, then a Baptist preacher, frequently visited him and was always
recognized by the family as his son.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Aside from the fact that the Cherokee acted as allies of the English
during the war in which Braddock&rsquo;s defeat occurred, and that
Sequoya, so far from being a preacher, was not even a Christian, the
story contains other elements of improbability and appears to be one of
those genealogical myths built upon a chance similarity of name. On the
other hand, it is certain that Sequoya was born before the date that
Phillips allows. On his mother&rsquo;s side he was of good family in
the tribe, his uncle being a chief in Echota.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3636src" href="#xd25e3636" name="xd25e3636src">266</a> According
to personal information of James Wafford, who knew him well, being his
second cousin, Sequoya was probably born about the year 1760, and lived
as a boy with his mother at Tuskegee town in Tennessee, just outside of
old Fort Loudon. It is quite possible that his white father may have
been a soldier of the garrison, one of those lovers for whom the
Cherokee women risked their lives during the siege.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e3642src" href="#xd25e3642" name="xd25e3642src">267</a> What
became of the father is not known, but the mother lived alone with her
son.</p>
<p>The only incident of his boyhood that has come down to us is his
presence at Echota during the visit of the Iroquois peace delegation,
about the year 1770.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3650src" href=
"#xd25e3650" name="xd25e3650src">268</a> His early years were spent
amid the stormy alarms of the Revolution, and as he grew to manhood he
developed a considerable mechanical ingenuity, especially in silver
working. Like most of his tribe he was also a hunter and fur trader.
Having nearly reached middle age before the first mission was
established in the Nation, he never attended school and in all his life
never learned to speak, read, or write the English language. Neither
did he ever abandon his native religion, although from frequent visits
to the Moravian mission he became imbued with a friendly feeling toward
the new civilization. Of an essentially contemplative disposition, he
was led by a chance conversation in 1809 to reflect upon the ability of
the white men to communicate thought by means of writing, with the
result that he set about devising a similar system for his own people.
By a hunting accident, which rendered him a cripple for life, he was
fortunately afforded more leisure for study. The presence of his name,
George Guess, appended to a treaty of 1816, indicates that he was
already of some prominence in the Nation, even before the perfection of
his great invention. After years of patient and unremitting labor in
the face of ridicule, discouragement, and repeated failure, he finally
evolved the Cherokee syllabary and in 1821 submitted it to a public
test by the leading men of the Nation. By this time, in consequence of
repeated cessions, the Cherokee had been dispossessed of the country
about Echota, and Sequoya was now living at Willstown, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>on
an upper branch of Coosa river, in Alabama. The syllabary was soon
recognized as an invaluable invention for the elevation of the tribe,
and within a few months thousands of hitherto illiterate Cherokee were
able to read and write their own language, teaching each other in the
cabins and along the roadside. The next year Sequoya visited the West,
to introduce the new science among those who had emigrated to the
Arkansas. In the next year, 1823, he again visited the Arkansas and
took up his permanent abode with the western band, never afterward
returning to his eastern kinsmen. In the autumn of the same year the
Cherokee national council made public acknowledgment of his merit by
sending to him, through John Ross, then president of the national
committee, a silver medal with a commemorative inscription in both
languages.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3658src" href="#xd25e3658" name=
"xd25e3658src">269</a> In 1828 he visited Washington as one of the
delegates from the Arkansas band, attracting much attention, and the
treaty made on that occasion contains a provision for the payment to
him of five hundred dollars, &ldquo;for the great benefits he has
conferred upon the Cherokee people, in the beneficial results which
they are now experiencing from the use of the alphabet discovered by
him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3664src" href="#xd25e3664" name=

will be treated in another place (40).<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The invention of the alphabet had an immediate and wonderful effect
on Cherokee development. On account of the remarkable adaptation of the
syllabary to the language, it was only necessary to learn the
characters to be able to read at once. No schoolhouses were built and
no teachers hired, but the whole Nation became an academy for the study
of the system, until, &ldquo;in the course of a few months, without
school or expense of time or money, the Cherokee were able to read and
write in their own language.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3675src" href=
"#xd25e3675" name="xd25e3675src">272</a> An active correspondence began
to be carried on between the eastern and western divisions, and plans
were made for a national press, with a national library and museum to
be established at the capital, New Echota.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3678src" href="#xd25e3678" name="xd25e3678src">273</a> The
missionaries, who had at first opposed the new alphabet on the ground
of its Indian origin, now saw the advisability of using it to further
their own work. In the fall of 1824 Ats&#301; or John Arch, a young
native convert, made a manuscript translation of a portion of St.
John&rsquo;s gospel, in the syllabary, this being the first Bible
translation ever given to the Cherokee. It was copied hundreds of times
and was widely disseminated through <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

"noteref" id="xd25e3686src" href="#xd25e3686" name=
"xd25e3686src">274</a> In September, 1825, David Brown, a prominent
half-breed preacher, who had already made some attempt at translation
in the Roman alphabet, completed a translation of the New Testament in
the new syllabary, the work being handed about in manuscript, as there
were as yet no types cast in the Sequoya characters.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e3689src" href="#xd25e3689" name="xd25e3689src">275</a> In the
same month he forwarded to Thomas McKenney, chief of the Bureau of
Indian Affairs at Washington, a manuscript table of the characters,
with explanation, this being probably its first introduction to
official notice.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3693src" href="#xd25e3693"
name="xd25e3693src">276</a></p>
<p>In 1827 the Cherokee council having formally resolved to establish a
national paper in the Cherokee language and characters, types for that
purpose were cast in Boston, under the supervision of the noted
missionary, Worcester, of the American Board of Commissioners for
Foreign Missions, who, in December of that year contributed to the
<i>Missionary Herald</i> five verses of Genesis in the new syllabary,
this seeming to be its first appearance in print. Early in the next
year the press and types arrived at New Echota, and the first number of
the new paper, <i>Tsa&prime;l&#259;g&#301;
Tsu&prime;lehisanu&ntilde;&prime;h&#301;</i>, the <i>Cherokee
Ph&oelig;nix</i>, printed in both languages, appeared on February 21,
1828. The first printers were two white men, Isaac N. Harris and John
F. Wheeler, with John Candy, a half-blood apprentice. Elias Boudinot
(G&#259;lagi&prime;na, &ldquo;The Buck&rdquo;), an educated Cherokee,
was the editor, and Reverend S. A. Worcester was the guiding spirit who
brought order out of chaos and set the work in motion. The office was a
log house. The hand press and types, after having been shipped by water
from Boston, were transported two hundred miles by wagon from Augusta
to their destination. The printing paper had been overlooked and had to
be brought by the same tedious process from Knoxville. Cases and other
equipments had to be devised and fashioned by the printers, neither of
whom understood a word of Cherokee, but simply set up the characters,
as handed to them in manuscript by Worcester and the editor. Such was
the beginning of journalism in the Cherokee nation. After a precarious
existence of about six years the <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i> was suspended,
owing to the hostile action of the Georgia authorities, who went so far
as to throw Worcester and Wheeler into prison. Its successor, after the
removal of the Cherokee to the West, was the <i>Cherokee Advocate</i>,
of which the first number appeared at Tahlequah in 1844, with William
P. Ross as editor. It is still continued under the auspices of the
Nation, printed in both languages and distributed free at the expense
of the Nation to those unable to read English&mdash;an example without
parallel in any other government.</p>
<p>In addition to numerous Bible translations, hymn books, and other
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>religious works, there have been printed in the
Cherokee language and syllabary the <i>Cherokee Ph&oelig;nix</i>
(journal), <i>Cherokee Advocate</i> (journal), <i>Cherokee
Messenger</i> (periodical), <i>Cherokee Almanac</i> (annual), Cherokee
spelling books, arithmetics, and other schoolbooks for those unable to
read English, several editions of the laws of the Nation, and a large
body of tracts and minor publications. Space forbids even a mention of
the names of the devoted workers in this connection. Besides this
printed literature the syllabary is in constant and daily use among the
non-English-speaking element, both in Indian Territory and in North
Carolina, for letter writing, council records, personal memoranda, etc.
What is perhaps strangest of all in this literary evolution is the fact
that the same invention has been seized by the priests and conjurers of
the conservative party for the purpose of preserving to their
successors the ancient rituals and secret knowledge of the tribe, whole
volumes of such occult literature in manuscript having been obtained
among them by the author.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3733src" href=
"#xd25e3733" name="xd25e3733src">277</a></p>
<p>In 1819 the whole Cherokee population had been estimated at 15,000,
one-third of them being west of the Mississippi. In 1825 a census of
the eastern Nation showed: native Cherokee, 13,563; white men married
into the Nation, 147; white women married into the Nation, 73; negro
slaves, 1,277. There were large herds of cattle, horses, hogs, and
sheep, with large crops of every staple, including cotton, tobacco, and
wheat, and some cotton was exported by boats as far as New Orleans.
Apple and peach orchards were numerous, butter and cheese were in use
to some extent, and both cotton and woolen cloths, especially blankets,
were manufactured. Nearly all the merchants were native Cherokee.
Mechanical industries flourished, the Nation was out of debt, and the
population was increasing.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3738src" href=
"#xd25e3738" name="xd25e3738src">278</a> Estimating one-third beyond
the Mississippi, the total number of Cherokee, exclusive of adopted
white citizens and negro slaves, must then have been about 20,000.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the decrees establishing a national press, the
Cherokee Nation, in general convention of delegates held for the
purpose at New Echota on July 26, 1827, adopted a national
constitution, based on the assumption of distinct and independent
nationality. John Ross, so celebrated in connection with the history of
his tribe, was president of the convention which framed the instrument.
Charles R. Hicks, a Moravian convert of mixed blood, and at that time
the most influential man in the Nation, was elected principal chief,
with John <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>Ross as assistant chief.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3748src" href="#xd25e3748" name="xd25e3748src">279</a> With a
constitution and national press, a well-developed system of industries
and home education, and a government administered by educated Christian
men, the Cherokee were now justly entitled to be considered a civilized
people.</p>

<p>The idea of a civilized Indian government was not a new one. The
first treaty ever negotiated by the United States with an Indian tribe,
in 1778, held out to the Delawares the hope that by a confederation of
friendly tribes they might be able &ldquo;to form a state, whereof the
Delaware nation shall be the head and have a representation in
Congress.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4251src" href="#xd25e4251"
name="xd25e4251src">280</a> Priber, the Jesuit, had already
familiarized the Cherokee with the forms of civilized government before
the middle of the eighteenth century. As the gap between the
conservative and progressive elements widened after the Revolution the
idea grew, until in 1808 representatives of both parties visited
Washington to propose an arrangement by which those who clung to the
old life might be allowed to remove to the western hunting grounds,
while the rest should remain to take up civilization and &ldquo;begin
the establishment of fixed laws and a regular government.&rdquo; The
project received the warm encouragement of President Jefferson, and it
was with this understanding that the western emigration was first
officially recognized a few years later. Immediately upon the return of
the delegates from Washington the Cherokee drew up their first brief
written code of laws, modeled agreeably to the friendly suggestions of
Jefferson.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4254src" href="#xd25e4254" name=
"xd25e4254src">281</a></p>
<p>By this time the rapid strides of civilization and Christianity had
alarmed the conservative element, who saw in the new order of things
only the evidences of apostasy and swift national decay. In 1828
White-path (N&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;n&acirc;-tsune&prime;ga), an
influential full-blood and councilor, living at Turniptown
(U&#699;l&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;), near the present Ellijay, in
Gilmer county, Georgia, headed a rebellion against the new code of
laws, with all that it implied. He soon had a large band of followers,
known to the whites as &ldquo;Red-sticks,&rdquo; a title sometimes
assumed by the more warlike element among the Creeks and other southern
tribes. From the townhouse of Ellijay he preached the rejection of the
new constitution, the discarding of Christianity and the white
man&rsquo;s ways, and a return to the old tribal law and
custom&mdash;the same doctrine that had more than once constituted the
burden of Indian revelation in the past. It was now too late, however,
to reverse the wheel of progress, and under the rule of such men as
Hicks and Ross the conservative opposition gradually melted away.
White-path was deposed from his seat <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>in council, but
subsequently made submission and was reinstated. He was afterward one
of the detachment commanders in the Removal, but died while on the
march.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4264src" href="#xd25e4264" name=
"xd25e4264src">282</a></p>
<p>In this year, also, John Ross became principal chief of the Nation,
a position which he held until his death in 1866, thirty-eight years
later.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4269src" href="#xd25e4269" name=
"xd25e4269src">283</a> In this long period, comprising the momentous
episodes of the Removal and the War of the Rebellion, it may be truly
said that his history is the history of the Nation.</p>
<p>And now, just when it seemed that civilization and enlightenment
were about to accomplish their perfect work, the Cherokee began to hear
the first low muttering of the coming storm that was soon to overturn
their whole governmental structure and sweep them forever from the land
of their birth.</p>
<p>By an agreement between the United States and the state of Georgia
in 1802, the latter, for valuable consideration, had ceded to the
general government her claims west of the present state boundary, the
United States at the same time agreeing to extinguish, at its own
expense, but for the benefit of the state, the Indian claims within the
state limits, &ldquo;as early as the same can be peaceably obtained on
reasonable terms.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4276src" href=
"#xd25e4276" name="xd25e4276src">284</a> In accordance with this
agreement several treaties had already been made with the Creeks and
Cherokee, by which large tracts had been secured for Georgia at the
expense of the general government. Notwithstanding this fact, and the
terms of the proviso, Georgia accused the government of bad faith in
not taking summary measures to compel the Indians at once to surrender
all their remaining lands within the chartered state limits, coupling
the complaint with a threat to take the matter into her own hands. In
1820 Agent Meigs had expressed the opinion that the Cherokee were now
so far advanced that further government aid was unnecessary, and that
their lands should be allotted and the surplus sold for their benefit,
they themselves to be invested with full rights of citizenship in the
several states within which they resided. This suggestion had been
approved by President Monroe, but had met the most determined
opposition from the states concerned. Tennessee absolutely refused to
recognize individual reservations made by previous treaties, while
North Carolina and Georgia bought in all such reservations with money
appropriated by Congress.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4288src" href=
"#xd25e4288" name="xd25e4288src">285</a> No Indian was to be allowed to
live within those states on any pretext whatsoever.</p>
<p>In the meantime, owing to persistent pressure from Georgia, repeated
unsuccessful efforts had been made to procure from the Cherokee a
cession of their lands within the chartered limits of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>state. Every effort met with a firm refusal, the
Indians declaring that having already made cession after cession from a
territory once extensive, their remaining lands were no more than were
needed for themselves and their children, more especially as experience
had shown that each concession would be followed by a further demand.
They conclude: &ldquo;It is the fixed and unalterable determination of
this nation never again to cede one foot more of land.&rdquo; Soon
afterward they addressed to the President a memorial of similar tenor,
to which Calhoun, as Secretary of War, returned answer that as Georgia
objected to their presence either as a tribe or as individual owners or
citizens, they must prepare their minds for removal beyond the
Mississippi.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4295src" href="#xd25e4295"
name="xd25e4295src">286</a></p>
<p>In reply, the Cherokee, by their delegates&mdash;John Ross, George
Lowrey, Major Ridge, and Elijah Hicks&mdash;sent a strong letter
calling attention to the fact that by the very wording of the 1802
agreement the compact was a conditional one which could not be carried
out without their own voluntary consent, and suggesting that Georgia
might be satisfied from the adjoining government lands in Florida.
Continuing, they remind the Secretary that the Cherokee are not
foreigners, but original inhabitants of America, inhabiting and
standing now upon the soil of their own territory, with limits defined
by treaties with the United States, and that, confiding in the good
faith of the government to respect its treaty stipulations, they do not
hesitate to say that their true interest, prosperity, and happiness
demand their permanency where they are and the retention of their
lands.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4303src" href="#xd25e4303" name=
"xd25e4303src">287</a></p>
<p>A copy of this letter was sent by the Secretary to Governor Troup of
Georgia, who returned a reply in which he blamed the missionaries for
the refusal of the Indians, declared that the state would not permit
them to become citizens, and that the Secretary must either assist the
state in taking possession of the Cherokee lands, or, in resisting that
occupancy, make war upon and shed the blood of brothers and friends.
The Georgia delegation in Congress addressed a similar letter to
President Monroe, in which the government was censured for having
instructed the Indians in the arts of civilized life and having thereby
imbued them with a desire to acquire property.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4311src" href="#xd25e4311" name="xd25e4311src">288</a></p>
<p>For answer the President submitted a report by Secretary Calhoun
showing that since the agreement had been made with Georgia in 1802 the
government had, at its own expense, extinguished the Indian claim to
24,600 square miles within the limits of that state, or more than
three-fifths of the whole Indian claim, and had paid on that and other
accounts connected with the agreement nearly seven and a half million
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>dollars, of which by far the greater part had
gone to Georgia or her citizens. In regard to the other criticism the
report states that the civilizing policy was as old as the government
itself, and that in performing the high duties of humanity to the
Indians, it had never been conceived that the stipulation of the
convention was contravened. In handing in the report the President
again called attention to the conditional nature of the agreement and
declared it as his opinion that the title of the Indians was not in the
slightest degree affected by it and that there was no obligation on the
United States to remove them by force.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4321src" href="#xd25e4321" name="xd25e4321src">289</a></p>
<p>Further efforts, even to the employment of secret methods, were made
in 1827 and 1828 to induce a cession or emigration, but without avail.
On July 26, 1827, as already noted, the Cherokee adopted a constitution
as a distinct and sovereign Nation. Upon this the Georgia legislature
passed resolutions affirming that that state &ldquo;had the power and
the right to possess herself, by any means she might choose, of the
lands in dispute, and to extend over them her authority and
laws,&rdquo; and recommending that this be done by the next
legislature, if the lands were not already acquired by successful
negotiation of the general government in the meantime. The government
was warned that the lands belonged to Georgia, and she must and would
have them. It was suggested, however, that the United States might be
permitted to make a certain number of reservations to individual
Indians.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4329src" href="#xd25e4329" name=
"xd25e4329src">290</a></p>
<p>Passing over for the present some important negotiations with the
western Cherokee, we come to the events leading to the final act in the
drama. Up to this time the pressure had been for land only, but now a
stronger motive was added. About the year 1815 a little Cherokee boy
playing along Chestatee river, in upper Georgia, had brought in to his
mother a shining yellow pebble hardly larger than the end of his thumb.
On being washed it proved to be a nugget of gold, and on her next trip
to the settlements the woman carried it with her and sold it to a white
man. The news spread, and although she probably concealed the knowledge
of the exact spot of its origin, it was soon known that the golden
dreams of De Soto had been realized in the Cherokee country of Georgia.
Within four years the whole territory east of the Chestatee had passed
from the possession of the Cherokee. They still held the western bank,
but the prospector was abroad in the mountains and it could not be for
long.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4334src" href="#xd25e4334" name=
"xd25e4334src">291</a> About 1828 gold was found on Ward&rsquo;s creek,
a western branch of Chestatee, near the present Dahlonega,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e4337src" href="#xd25e4337" name=
"xd25e4337src">292</a> and the doom of the nation was sealed (41).
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span></p>
<p>In November, 1828, Andrew Jackson was elected to succeed John Quincy
Adams as President. He was a frontiersman and Indian hater, and the
change boded no good to the Cherokee. His position was well understood,
and there is good ground for believing that the action at once taken by
Georgia was at his own suggestion.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4344src"
href="#xd25e4344" name="xd25e4344src">293</a> On December 20, 1828, a
month after his election, Georgia passed an act annexing that part of
the Cherokee country within her chartered limits and extending over it
her jurisdiction; all laws and customs established among the Cherokee
were declared null and void, and no person of Indian blood or descent
residing within the Indian country was henceforth to be allowed as a
witness or party in any suit where a white man should be defendant. The
act was to take effect June 1, 1830 (42). The whole territory was soon
after mapped out into counties and surveyed by state surveyors into
&ldquo;land lots&rdquo; of 160 acres each, and &ldquo;gold lots&rdquo;
of 40 acres, which were put up and distributed among the white citizens
of Georgia by public lottery, each white citizen receiving a ticket.
Every Cherokee head of a family was, indeed, allowed a reservation of
160 acres, but no deed was given, and his continuance depended solely
on the pleasure of the legislature. Provision was made for the
settlement of contested lottery claims among the white citizens, but by
the most stringent enactments, in addition to the sweeping law which
forbade anyone of Indian blood to bring suit or to testify against a
white man, it was made impossible for the Indian owner to defend his
right in any court or to resist the seizure of his homestead, or even
his own dwelling house, and anyone so resisting was made subject to
imprisonment at the discretion of a Georgia court. Other laws directed
to the same end quickly followed, one of which made invalid any
contract between a white man and an Indian unless established by the
testimony of two white witnesses&mdash;thus practically canceling all
debts due from white men to Indians&mdash;while another obliged all
white men residing in the Cherokee country to take a special oath of
allegiance to the state of Georgia, on penalty of four years&rsquo;
imprisonment in the penitentiary, this act being intended to drive out
all the missionaries, teachers, and other educators who refused to
countenance the spoliation. About the same time the Cherokee were
forbidden to hold councils, or to assemble for any public
purpose,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4347src" href="#xd25e4347" name=
"xd25e4347src">294</a> or to dig for gold upon their own lands.

<p>The purpose of this legislation was to render life in their own
country intolerable to the Cherokee by depriving them of all legal
protection and friendly counsel, and the effect was precisely as
intended. In an eloquent address upon the subject before the House of
Representatives the distinguished Edward Everett clearly pointed out
the encouragement which it gave to lawless men: &ldquo;They have but to
cross the Cherokee line; they have but to choose the time and the place
where the eye of no white man can rest upon them, and they may burn the
dwelling, waste the farm, plunder the property, assault the person,
murder the children of the Cherokee subject of Georgia, and though
hundreds of the tribe may be looking on, there is not one of them that
can be permitted to bear witness against the spoiler.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e4353src" href="#xd25e4353" name=
"xd25e4353src">295</a> Senator Sprague, of Maine, said of the law that
it devoted the property of the Cherokee to the cupidity of their
neighbors, leaving them exposed to every outrage which lawless persons
could inflict, so that even robbery and murder might be committed with
impunity at noonday, if not in the presence of whites who would testify
against it.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4356src" href="#xd25e4356" name=
"xd25e4356src">296</a></p>
<p>The prediction was fulfilled to the letter. Bands of armed men
invaded the Cherokee country, forcibly seizing horses and cattle,
taking possession of houses from which they had ejected the occupants,
and assaulting the owners who dared to make resistance.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e4361src" href="#xd25e4361" name=
"xd25e4361src">297</a> In one instance, near the present Dahlonega, two
white men, who had been hospitably received and entertained at supper
by an educated Cherokee citizen of nearly pure white blood, later in
the evening, during the temporary absence of the parents, drove out the
children and their nurse and deliberately set fire to the house, which
was burned to the ground with all its contents. They were pursued and
brought to trial, but the case was dismissed by the judge on the ground
that no Indian could testify against a white man.<a class="noteref" id=

although, not understanding English, he was unable to speak in his own

execution, and stood beside the sheriff while the Indian was being
hanged.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4370src" href="#xd25e4370" name=

<p>Immediately on the passage of the first act the Cherokee appealed to
President Jackson, but were told that no protection would be afforded
them. Other efforts were then made&mdash;in 1829&mdash;to persuade them
to removal, or to procure another cession&mdash;this time of all their
lands in North Carolina&mdash;but the Cherokee remained firm. The
Georgia law was declared in force on June 3, 1830, whereupon the
President directed that the annuity payment due the Cherokee Nation
under previous treaties should no longer be paid to their national
treasurer, as hitherto, but distributed per capita by the agent. As a
national fund it had been used for the maintenance of their schools and
national press. As a per capita payment it amounted to forty-two cents
to each individual. Several years afterward it still remained unpaid.
Federal troops were also sent into the Cherokee country with orders to
prevent all mining by either whites or Indians unless authorized by the
state of Georgia. All these measures served only to render the Cherokee
more bitter in their determination. In September, 1830, another
proposition was made for the removal of the tribe, but the national
council emphatically refused to consider the subject.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e4376src" href="#xd25e4376" name="xd25e4376src">301</a></p>
<p>In January, 1831, the Cherokee Nation, by John Ross as principal
chief, brought a test suit of injunction against Georgia, in the United
States Supreme Court. The majority of the court dismissed the suit on
the ground that the Cherokee were not a foreign nation within the
meaning of the Constitution, two justices dissenting from this
opinion.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4381src" href="#xd25e4381" name=
"xd25e4381src">302</a></p>
<p>Shortly afterward, under the law which forbade any white man to
reside in the Cherokee Nation without taking an oath of allegiance to
Georgia, a number of arrests were made, including Wheeler, the printer
of the <i>Cherokee Ph&oelig;nix</i>, and the missionaries, Worcester,
Butler, Thompson, and Proctor, who, being there by permission of the
agent and feeling that plain American citizenship should hold good in
any part of the United States, refused to take the oath. Some of those
arrested took the oath and were released, but Worcester and Butler,
still refusing, were dressed in prison garb and put at hard labor among
felons. Worcester had plead in his defense that he was a citizen of
Vermont, and had entered the Cherokee country by permission of the
President of the United States and approval of the Cherokee Nation; and
that as the United States by several treaties had acknowledged the
Cherokee to be a nation with a guaranteed and definite territory, the
state had no right to interfere with him. He was sentenced to four
years in the penitentiary. On March 3, 1832, the matter was appealed as
a test case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which rendered a
decision in favor of Worcester and the Cherokee Nation and ordered his
release. Georgia, however, through her governor, had defied the summons
with a threat of opposition, even to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>annihilation of the
Union, and now ignored the decision, refusing to release the
missionary, who remained in prison until set free by the will of the
governor nearly a year later. A remark attributed to President Jackson,
on hearing of the result in the Supreme Court, may throw some light on
the whole proceeding: &ldquo;John Marshall has made his decision, now
let him enforce it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4391src" href=
"#xd25e4391" name="xd25e4391src">303</a></p>
<p>On the 19th of July, 1832, a public fast was observed throughout the
Cherokee Nation. In the proclamation recommending it, Chief Ross
observes that &ldquo;Whereas the crisis in the affairs of the Nation
exhibits the day of tribulation and sorrow, and the time appears to be
fast hastening when the destiny of this people must be sealed; whether
it has been directed by the wonted depravity and wickedness of man, or
by the unsearchable and mysterious will of an allwise Being, it equally
becomes us, as a rational and Christian community, humbly to bow in
humiliation,&rdquo; etc.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4396src" href=
"#xd25e4396" name="xd25e4396src">304</a></p>
<p>Further attempts were made to induce the Cherokee to remove to the
West, but met the same firm refusal as before. It was learned that in
view of the harrassing conditions to which they were subjected the
Cherokee were now seriously considering the project of emigrating to
the Pacific Coast, at the mouth of the Columbia, a territory then
claimed by England and held by the posts of the British Hudson Bay
Company. The Secretary of War at once took steps to discourage the
movement.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4401src" href="#xd25e4401" name=
"xd25e4401src">305</a> A suggestion from the Cherokee that the
government satisfy those who had taken possession of Cherokee lands
under the lottery drawing by giving them instead an equivalent from the
unoccupied government lands was rejected by the President.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1834 the Cherokee submitted a memorial which, after
asserting that they would never voluntarily consent to abandon their
homes, proposed to satisfy Georgia by ceding to her a portion of their
territory, they to be protected in possession of the remainder until
the end of a definite period to be fixed by the United States, at the
expiration of which, after disposing of their surplus lands, they
should become citizens of the various states within which they resided.
They were told that their difficulties could be remedied only by their
removal to the west of the Mississippi. In the meantime a removal
treaty was being negotiated with a self-styled committee of some
fifteen or twenty Cherokee called together at the agency. It was
carried through in spite of the protest of John Ross and the Cherokee
Nation, as embodied in a paper said to contain the signatures of 13,000
Cherokee, but failed of ratification.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4406src" href="#xd25e4406" name="xd25e4406src">306</a></p>
<p>Despairing of any help from the President, the Cherokee delegation,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>headed by John Ross, addressed another earnest
memorial to Congress on May 17, 1834. Royce quotes the document at
length, with the remark, &ldquo;Without affecting to pass judgment on
the merits of the controversy, the writer thinks this memorial well
deserving of reproduction here as evidencing the devoted and pathetic
attachment with which the Cherokee clung to the land of their fathers,
and, remembering the wrongs and humiliations of the past, refused to be
convinced that justice, prosperity, and happiness awaited them beyond
the Mississippi.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4413src" href=
"#xd25e4413" name="xd25e4413src">307</a></p>
<p>In August of this year another council was held at Red Clay,
south-eastward from Chattanooga and just within the Georgia line, where
the question of removal was again debated in what is officially
described as a tumultuous and excited meeting. One of the principal
advocates of the emigration scheme, a prominent mixed-blood named John
Walker, jr., was assassinated from ambush while returning from the
council to his home a few miles north of the present Cleveland,
Tennessee. On account of his superior education and influential
connections, his wife being a niece of former agent Return J. Meigs,
the affair created intense excitement at the time. The assassination
has been considered the first of the long series of political murders
growing out of the removal agitation, but, according to the testimony
of old Cherokee acquainted with the facts, the killing was due to a
more personal motive.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4418src" href=
"#xd25e4418" name="xd25e4418src">308</a></p>
<p>The Cherokee were now nearly worn out by constant battle against a
fate from which they could see no escape. In February, 1835, two rival
delegations arrived in Washington<span class="corr" id="xd25e4424"
title="Source: ,">.</span> One, the national party, headed by John
Ross, came prepared still to fight to the end for home and national
existence. The other, headed by Major John Ridge, a prominent subchief,
despairing of further successful resistance, was prepared to negotiate
for removal. Reverend J. F. Schermerhorn was appointed commissioner to
arrange with the Ridge party a treaty to be confirmed later by the
Cherokee people in general council. On this basis a treaty was
negotiated with the Ridge party by which the Cherokee were to cede
their whole eastern territory and remove to the West in consideration
of the sum of $3,250,000 with some additional acreage in the West and a
small sum for depredations committed upon them by the whites. Finding
that these negotiations were proceeding, the Ross party filed a counter
proposition for $20,000,000, which was rejected by the Senate as
excessive. The Schermerhorn compact with the Ridge party, with the
consideration changed to $4,500,000, was thereupon completed and signed
on March 14, 1835, but with the express stipulation that it should
receive the approval of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href=
"#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>the Cherokee nation in full
council assembled before being considered of any binding force. This
much accomplished, Mr. Schermerhorn departed for the Cherokee country,
armed with an address from President Jackson in which the great
benefits of removal were set forth to the Cherokee. Having exhausted
the summer and fall in fruitless effort to secure favorable action, the
reverend gentleman notified the President, proposing either to obtain
the signatures of the leading Cherokee by promising them payment for
their improvements at their own valuation, if in any degree reasonable,
or to conclude a treaty with a part of the Nation and compel its
acceptance by the rest. He was promptly informed by the Secretary of
War, Lewis Cass, on behalf of the President, that the treaty, if
concluded at all, must be procured upon fair and open terms, with no
particular promise to any individual, high or low, to gain his aid or
influence, and without sacrificing the interest of the whole to the
cupidity of a few. He was also informed that, as it would probably be
contrary to his wish, his letter would not be put on file.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e4429src" href="#xd25e4429" name=
"xd25e4429src">309</a></p>
<p>In October, 1835, the Ridge treaty was rejected by the Cherokee
Nation in full council at Red Clay, even its main supporters, Ridge
himself and Elias Boudinot, going over to the majority, most
unexpectedly to Schermerhorn, who reports the result, piously adding,
&ldquo;but the Lord is able to overrule all things for good.&rdquo;
During the session of this council notice was served on the Cherokee to
meet commissioners at New Echota in December following for the purpose
of negotiating a treaty. The notice was also printed in the Cherokee
language and circulated throughout the Nation, with a statement that
those who failed to attend would be counted as assenting to any treaty
that might be made.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4434src" href=
"#xd25e4434" name="xd25e4434src">310</a></p>
<p>The council had authorized the regular delegation, headed by John
Ross, to conclude a treaty either there or at Washington, but, finding
that Schermerhorn had no authority to treat on any other basis than the
one rejected by the Nation, the delegates proceeded to
Washington.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4439src" href="#xd25e4439" name=
"xd25e4439src">311</a> Before their departure John Ross, who had
removed to Tennessee to escape persecution in his own state, was
arrested at his home by the Georgia guard, all his private papers and
the proceedings of the council being taken at the same time, and
conveyed across the line into Georgia, where he was held for some time
without charge against him, and at last released without apology or
explanation. The poet, John Howard Payne, who was then stopping with
Ross, engaged in the work of collecting historical and ethnologic
material relating to the Cherokee, was seized at the same time, with
all his letters and scientific <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123"
href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>manuscripts. The national
paper, the <i>Cherokee Ph&oelig;nix</i>, had been suppressed and its
office plant seized by the same guard a few days before.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e4447src" href="#xd25e4447" name=
"xd25e4447src">312</a> Thus in their greatest need the Cherokee were
deprived of the help and counsel of their teachers, their national
press, and their chief.</p>
<p>Although for two months threats and inducements had been held out to
secure a full attendance at the December conference at New Echota,
there were present when the proceedings opened, according to the report
of Schermerhorn himself, only from three hundred to five hundred men,
women, and children, out of a population of over 17,000.
Notwithstanding the paucity of attendance and the absence of the
principal officers of the Nation, a committee was appointed to arrange
the details of a treaty, which was finally drawn up and signed on
December 29, 1835.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4452src" href=
"#xd25e4452" name="xd25e4452src">313</a></p>
<p>Briefly stated, by this treaty of New Echota, Georgia, the Cherokee
Nation ceded to the United States its whole remaining territory east of
the Mississippi for the sum of five million dollars and a common joint
interest in the territory already occupied by the western Cherokee, in
what is now Indian Territory, with an additional smaller tract
adjoining on the northeast, in what is now Kansas. Improvements were to
be paid for, and the Indians were to be removed at the expense of the
United States and subsisted at the expense of the Government for one
year after their arrival in the new country. The removal was to take
place within two years from the ratification of the treaty.</p>
<p>On the strong representations of the Cherokee signers, who would
probably not have signed otherwise even then, it was agreed that a
limited number of Cherokee who should desire to remain behind in North
Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama, and become citizens, having first
been adjudged &ldquo;qualified or calculated to become useful
citizens,&rdquo; might so remain, together with a few holding
individual reservations under former treaties. This provision was
allowed by the commissioners, but was afterward struck out on the
announcement by President Jackson of his determination &ldquo;not to
allow any preemptions or reservations, his desire being that the whole
Cherokee people should remove together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Provision was made also for the payment of debts due by the Indians
out of any moneys coming to them under the treaty; for the
reestablishment of the missions in the West; for pensions to Cherokee
wounded in the service of the government in the war of 1812 and the
Creek war; for permission to establish in the new country such military
posts and roads for the use of the United States as should be deemed
necessary; for satisfying Osage claims in the western territory and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>for bringing about a friendly understanding
between the two tribes; and for the commutation of all annuities and
other sums due from the United States into a permanent national fund,
the interest to be placed at the disposal of the officers of the
Cherokee Nation and by them disbursed, according to the will of their
own people, for the care of schools and orphans, and for general
national purposes.</p>
<p>The western territory assigned the Cherokee under this treaty was in
two adjoining tracts, viz, (1) a tract of seven million acres, together
with a &ldquo;perpetual outlet west,&rdquo; already assigned to the
western Cherokee under treaty of 1833, as will hereafter be
noted,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4465src" href="#xd25e4465" name=
"xd25e4465src">314</a> being identical with the present area occupied
by the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory, together with the former
&ldquo;Cherokee strip,&rdquo; with the exception of a two-mile strip
along the northern boundary, now included within the limits of Kansas;
(2) a smaller additional tract of eight hundred thousand acres, running
fifty miles north and south and twenty-five miles east and west, in
what is now the southeastern corner of Kansas. For this second tract
the Cherokee themselves were to pay the United States five hundred
thousand dollars.</p>
<p>The treaty of 1833, assigning the first described tract to the
western Cherokee, states that the United States agrees to
&ldquo;guaranty it to them forever, and that guarantee is hereby
pledged.&rdquo; By the same treaty, &ldquo;in addition to the seven
millions of acres of land thus provided for and bounded, the United
States further guaranty to the Cherokee nation a perpetual outlet west
and a free and unmolested use of all the country lying west of the
western boundary of said seven millions of acres, as far west as the
sovereignty of the United States and their right of soil extend
&hellip; and letters patent shall be issued by the United States as
soon as practicable for the land hereby guaranteed.&rdquo; All this was
reiterated by the present treaty, and made to include also the smaller
(second) tract, in these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Art. 3.</span> The United States also
agree that the lands above ceded by the treaty of February 14, 1833,
including the outlet, and those ceded by this treaty, shall all be
included in one patent, executed to the Cherokee nation of Indians by
the President of the United States, according to the provisions of the
act of May 28, 1830&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Art. 5.</span> The United States hereby covenant
and agree that the lands ceded to the Cherokee nation in the foregoing
article shall in no future time, without their consent, be included
within the territorial limits or jurisdiction of any state or
territory. But they shall secure to the Cherokee nation the right of
their national councils to make and carry into effect all such laws as
they may deem necessary for the government and protection of the
persons and property within their own country belonging to their people
or such persons as have connected themselves with them: Provided
always, that they shall not be inconsistent with the Constitution of
the United States and such acts of Congress as have been or may be
passed regulating trade and intercourse with the Indians; and also that
they shall not be considered as extending to such citizens and army of
the United States as may travel or reside in the Indian <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>country by permission, according to the laws and
regulations established by the government of the
same&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Art. 6.</span> Perpetual peace and friendship shall
exist between the citizens of the United States and the Cherokee
Indians. The United States agree to protect the Cherokee nation from
domestic strife and foreign enemies and against intestine wars between
the several tribes. The Cherokees shall endeavor to preserve and
maintain the peace of the country, and not make war upon their
neighbors; they shall also be protected against interruption and
intrusion from citizens of the United States who may attempt to settle
in the country without their consent; and all such persons shall be
removed from the same by order of the President of the United States.
But this is not intended to prevent the residence among them of useful
farmers, mechanics, and teachers for the instruction of the Indians
according to treaty stipulations.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Article 7.</span> The Cherokee nation having
already made great progress in civilization, and deeming it important
that every proper and laudable inducement should be offered to their
people to improve their condition, as well as to guard and secure in
the most effectual manner the rights guaranteed to them in this treaty,
and with a view to illustrate the liberal and enlarged policy of the
government of the United States toward the Indians in their removal
beyond the territorial limits of the states, it is stipulated that they
shall be entitled to a Delegate in the House of Representatives of the
United States whenever Congress shall make provision for the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The instrument was signed by (Governor) William Carroll of Tennessee
and (Reverend) J. F. Schermerhorn as commissioners&mdash;the former,
however, having been unable to attend by reason of illness&mdash;and by
twenty Cherokee, among whom the most prominent were Major Ridge and
Elias Boudinot, former editor of the <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i>. Neither John
Ross nor any one of the officers of the Cherokee Nation was present or
represented. After some changes by the Senate, it was ratified May 23,
1836.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4495src" href="#xd25e4495" name=
"xd25e4495src">315</a></p>
<p>Upon the treaty of New Echota and the treaty previously made with
the western Cherokee at Fort Gibson in 1833, the united Cherokee Nation
based its claim to the present territory held by the tribe in Indian
Territory and to the Cherokee outlet, and to national self-government,
with protection from outside intrusion.</p>
<p>An official census taken in 1835 showed the whole number of Cherokee
in Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee to be 16,542,
exclusive of 1,592 negro slaves and 201 whites intermarried with
Cherokee. The Cherokee were distributed as follows: Georgia, 8,946;
North Carolina, 3,644; Tennessee, 2,528; Alabama, 1,424.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e4506src" href="#xd25e4506" name=
"xd25e4506src">316</a></p>
<p>Despite the efforts of Ross and the national delegates, who
presented protests with signatures representing nearly 16,000 Cherokee,
the treaty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>had been ratified by a majority of one vote over
the necessary number, and preliminary steps were at once taken to carry
it into execution. Councils were held in opposition all over the
Cherokee Nation, and resolutions denouncing the methods used and
declaring the treaty absolutely null and void were drawn up and
submitted to General Wool, in command of the troops in the Cherokee
country, by whom they were forwarded to Washington. The President in
reply expressed his surprise that an officer of the army should have
received or transmitted a paper so disrespectful to the Executive, the
Senate, and the American people; declared his settled determination
that the treaty should be carried out without modification and with all
consistent dispatch, and directed that after a copy of the letter had
been delivered to Ross, no further communication, by mouth or writing,
should be held with him concerning the treaty. It was further directed
that no council should be permitted to assemble to discuss the treaty.
Ross had already been informed that the President had ceased to
recognize any existing government among the eastern Cherokee, and that
any further effort by him to prevent the consummation of the treaty
would be suppressed.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4513src" href=
"#xd25e4513" name="xd25e4513src">317</a></p>
<p>Notwithstanding this suppression of opinion, the feeling of the
Nation was soon made plain through other sources. Before the
ratification of the treaty Major W. M. Davis had been appointed to
enroll the Cherokee for removal and to appraise the value of their
improvements. He soon learned the true condition of affairs, and,
although holding his office by the good will of President Jackson, he
addressed to the Secretary of War a strong letter upon the subject,
from which the following extract is made:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I conceive that my duty to the President, to yourself,
and to my country reluctantly compels me to make a statement of facts
in relation to a meeting of a small number of Cherokees at New Echota
last December, who were met by Mr. Schermerhorn and articles of a
general treaty entered into between them for the whole Cherokee
nation&#8202;&hellip;. Sir, that paper, &hellip; called a treaty, is no
treaty at all, because not sanctioned by the great body of the Cherokee
and made without their participation or assent. I solemnly declare to
you that upon its reference to the Cherokee people it would be
instantly rejected by nine-tenths of them, and I believe by
nineteen-twentieths of them. There were not present at the conclusion
of the treaty more than one hundred Cherokee voters, and not more than
three hundred, including women and children, although the weather was
everything that could be desired. The Indians had long been notified of
the meeting, and blankets were promised to all who would come and vote
for the treaty. The most cunning and artful means were resorted to to
conceal the paucity of numbers present at the treaty. No enumeration of
them was made by Schermerhorn. The business of making the treaty was
transacted with a committee appointed by the Indians present, so as not
to expose their numbers. The power of attorney under which the
committee acted was signed only by the president and secretary of the
meeting, so as not to disclose their weakness&#8202;&hellip;. Mr.
Schermerhorn&rsquo;s apparent design was to conceal the real number

<p>General Wool, who had been placed in command of the troops
concentrated in the Cherokee country to prevent opposition to the
enforcement of the treaty, reported on February 18, 1837, that he had
called them together and made them an address, but &ldquo;it is,
however, vain to talk to a people almost universally opposed to the
treaty and who maintain that they never made such a treaty. So
determined are they in their opposition that not one of all those who
were present and voted at the council held but a day or two since,
however poor or destitute, would receive either rations or clothing
from the United States lest they might compromise themselves in regard
to the treaty. These same people, as well as those in the mountains of
North Carolina, during the summer past, preferred living upon the roots
and sap of trees rather than receive provisions from the United States,
and thousands, as I have been informed, had no other food for weeks.
Many have said they will die before they will leave the
country.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4528src" href="#xd25e4528"
name="xd25e4528src">319</a></p>
<p>Other letters from General Wool while engaged in the work of
disarming and overawing the Cherokee show how very disagreeable that
duty was to him and how strongly his sympathies were with the Indians,
who were practically unanimous in repudiating the treaty. In one letter
he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The whole scene since I have been in this country has
been nothing but a heart-rending one, and such a one as I would be glad
to get rid of as soon as circumstances will permit. Because I am firm
and decided, do not believe I would be unjust. If I could, and I could
not do them a greater kindness, I would remove every Indian to-morrow
beyond the reach of the white men, who, like vultures, are watching,
ready to pounce upon their prey and strip them of everything they have
or expect from the government of the United States. Yes, sir,
nineteen-twentieths, if not ninety-nine out of every hundred, will go
penniless to the West.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4536src" href=
"#xd25e4536" name="xd25e4536src">320</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How it was to be brought about is explained in part by a letter
addressed to the President by Major Ridge himself, the principal signer
of the treaty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We now come to address you on the subject of our
griefs and afflictions from the acts of the white people. They have got
our lands and now they are preparing to fleece us of the money accruing
from the treaty. We found our plantations taken either in whole or in
part by the Georgians&mdash;suits instituted against us for back rents
for our own farms. These suits are commenced in the inferior courts,
with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>evident design that, when we are ready to
remove, to arrest our people, and on these vile claims to induce us to
compromise for our own release, to travel with our families. Thus our
funds will be filched from our people, and we shall be compelled to
leave our country as beggars and in want.</p>
<p>Even the Georgia laws, which deny us our oaths, are thrown aside,
and notwithstanding the cries of our people, and protestation of our
innocence and peace, the lowest classes of the white people are
flogging the Cherokees with cowhides, hickories, and clubs. We are not
safe in our houses&mdash;our people are assailed by day and night by
the rabble. Even justices of the peace and constables are concerned in
this business. This barbarous treatment is not confined to men, but the
women are stripped also and whipped without law or
mercy&#8202;&hellip;. Send regular troops to protect us from these
lawless assaults, and to protect our people as they depart for the
West. If it is not done, we shall carry off nothing but the scars of
the lash on our backs, and our oppressors will get all the money. We
talk plainly, as chiefs having property and life in danger, and we
appeal to you for protection&#8202;&hellip;.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>General Dunlap, in command of the Tennessee troops called out to
prevent the alleged contemplated Cherokee uprising, having learned for
himself the true situation, delivered an indignant address to his men
in which he declared that he would never dishonor the Tennessee arms by
aiding to carry into execution at the point of the bayonet a treaty
made by a lean minority against the will and authority of the Cherokee
people. He stated further that he had given the Cherokee all the
protection in his power, the whites needing none.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4553src" href="#xd25e4553" name="xd25e4553src">322</a></p>
<p>A confidential agent sent to report upon the situation wrote in
September, 1837, that opposition to the treaty was unanimous and
irreconcilable, the Cherokee declaring that it could not bind them
because they did not make it, that it was the work of a few
unauthorized individuals and that the Nation was not a party to it.
They had retained the forms of their government, although no election
had been held since 1830, having continued the officers then in charge
until their government could again be reestablished regularly. Under
this arrangement John Ross was principal chief, with influence
unbounded and unquestioned. &ldquo;The whole Nation of eighteen
thousand persons is with him, the few&mdash;about three
hundred&mdash;who made the treaty having left the country, with the
exception of a small number of prominent individuals&mdash;as Ridge,
Boudinot, and others&mdash;who remained to assist in carrying it into
execution. It is evident, therefore, that Ross and his party are in
fact the Cherokee Nation&#8202;&hellip;. I believe that the mass of the
Nation, particularly the mountain Indians, will stand or fall with
Ross&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4558src" href=
"#xd25e4558" name="xd25e4558src">323</a></p>
<p>So intense was public feeling on the subject of this treaty that it
became to some extent a party question, the Democrats supporting
President Jackson while the Whigs bitterly opposed him. Among
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>notable leaders of the opposition were Henry
Clay, Daniel Webster, Edward Everett, Wise of Virginia, and David
Crockett. The speeches in Congress upon the subject &ldquo;were
characterized by a depth and bitterness of feeling such as had never
been exceeded even on the slavery question.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e4565src" href="#xd25e4565" name="xd25e4565src">324</a> It was
considered not simply an Indian question, but an issue between state
rights on the one hand and federal jurisdiction and the Constitution on
the other.</p>
<p>In spite of threats of arrest and punishment, Ross still continued
active effort in behalf of his people. Again, in the spring of 1838,
two months before the time fixed for the removal, he presented to
Congress another protest and memorial, which, like the others, was
tabled by the Senate. Van Buren had now succeeded Jackson and was
disposed to allow the Cherokee a longer time to prepare for emigration,
but was met by the declaration from Governor Gilmer of Georgia that any
delay would be a violation of the rights of that state and in
opposition to the rights of <i>the owners of the soil</i>, and that if
trouble came from any protection afforded by the government troops to
the Cherokee a direct collision must ensue between the authorities of
the state and general government.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4573src"
href="#xd25e4573" name="xd25e4573src">325</a></p>
<p>Up to the last moment the Cherokee still believed that the treaty
would not be consummated, and with all the pressure brought to bear
upon them only about 2,000 of the 17,000 in the eastern Nation had
removed at the expiration of the time fixed for their departure, May
26, 1838. As it was evident that the removal could only be accomplished
by force, General Winfield Scott was now appointed to that duty with
instructions to start the Indians for the West at the earliest possible
moment. For that purpose he was ordered to take command of the troops
already in the Cherokee country, together with additional
reenforcements of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with authority to
call upon the governors of the adjoining states for as many as 4,000
militia and volunteers. The whole force employed numbered about 7,000
men&mdash;regulars, militia, and volunteers.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4578src" href="#xd25e4578" name="xd25e4578src">326</a> The
Indians had already been disarmed by General Wool.</p>
<p>On arriving in the Cherokee country Scott established headquarters
at the capital, New Echota, whence, on May 10, he issued a proclamation
to the Cherokee, warning them that the emigration must be commenced in
haste and that before another moon had passed every Cherokee man,
woman, and child must be in motion to join his brethren in the far
West, according to the determination of the President, which he, the
general, had come to enforce. The proclamation concludes: &ldquo;My
troops already occupy many positions &hellip; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=

every quarter to render resistance and escape alike
hopeless&#8202;&hellip;. Will you, then, by resistance compel us to
resort to arms &hellip; or will you by flight seek to hide yourselves
in mountains and forests and thus oblige us to hunt you
down?&rdquo;&mdash;reminding them that pursuit might result in conflict
and bloodshed, ending in a general war.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4586src" href="#xd25e4586" name="xd25e4586src">327</a></p>
<p>Even after this Ross endeavored, on behalf of his people, to secure
some slight modification of the terms of the treaty, but without
avail.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4591src" href="#xd25e4591" name=

<h4 class="main">THE REMOVAL&mdash;1838&ndash;39</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The history of this Cherokee removal of 1838, as
gleaned by the author from the lips of actors in the tragedy, may well
exceed in weight of grief and pathos any other passage in American
history. Even the much-sung exile of the Acadians falls far behind it
in its sum of death and misery. Under Scott&rsquo;s orders the troops
were disposed at various points throughout the Cherokee country, where
stockade forts were erected for gathering in and holding the Indians
preparatory to removal (43). From these, squads of troops were sent to
search out with rifle and bayonet every small cabin hidden away in the
coves or by the sides of mountain streams, to seize and bring in as
prisoners all the occupants, however or wherever they might be found.
Families at dinner were startled by the sudden gleam of bayonets in the
doorway and rose up to be driven with blows and oaths along the weary
miles of trail that led to the stockade. Men were seized in their
fields or going along the road, women were taken from their wheels and
children from their play. In many cases, on turning for one last look
as they crossed the ridge, they saw their homes in flames, fired by the
lawless rabble that followed on the heels of the soldiers to loot and
pillage. So keen were these outlaws on the scent that in some instances
they were driving off the cattle and other stock of the Indians almost
before the soldiers had fairly started their owners in the other
direction. Systematic hunts were made by the same men for Indian
graves, to rob them of the silver pendants and other valuables
deposited with the dead. A Georgia volunteer, afterward a colonel in
the Confederate service, said: &ldquo;I fought through the civil war
and have seen men shot to pieces and slaughtered by thousands, but the
Cherokee removal was the cruelest work I ever knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To prevent escape the soldiers had been ordered to approach and
surround each house, so far as possible, so as to come upon the
occupants without warning. One old patriarch, when thus surprised,
calmly called his children and grandchildren around him, and, kneeling
down, bid them pray with him in their own language, while the
astonished soldiers looked on in silence. Then rising he led the way
into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>exile. A woman, on finding the house surrounded,
went to the door and called up the chickens to be fed for the last
time, after which, taking her infant on her back and her two other
children by the hand, she followed her husband with the soldiers.</p>
<p>All were not thus submissive. One old man named Tsal&#301;,
&ldquo;Charley,&rdquo; was seized with his wife, his brother, his three
sons and their families. Exasperated at the brutality accorded his
wife, who, being unable to travel fast, was prodded with bayonets to
hasten her steps, he urged the other men to join with him in a dash for
liberty. As he spoke in Cherokee the soldiers, although they heard,
understood nothing until each warrior suddenly sprang upon the one
nearest and endeavored to wrench his gun from him. The attack was so
sudden and unexpected that one soldier was killed and the rest fled,
while the Indians escaped to the mountains. Hundreds of others, some of
them from the various stockades, managed also to escape to the
mountains from time to time, where those who did not die of starvation
subsisted on roots and wild berries until the hunt was over. Finding it
impracticable to secure these fugitives, General Scott finally tendered
them a proposition, through (Colonel) W. H. Thomas, their most trusted
friend, that if they would surrender Charley and his party for
punishment, the rest would be allowed to remain until their case could
be adjusted by the government. On hearing of the proposition, Charley
voluntarily came in with his sons, offering himself as a sacrifice for
his people. By command of General Scott, Charley, his brother, and the
two elder sons were shot near the mouth of Tuckasegee, a detachment of
Cherokee prisoners being compelled to do the shooting in order to
impress upon the Indians the fact of their utter helplessness. From
those fugitives thus permitted to remain originated the present eastern
band of Cherokee.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4605src" href="#xd25e4605"
name="xd25e4605src">329</a></p>
<p>When nearly seventeen thousand Cherokee had thus been gathered into
the various stockades the work of removal began. Early in June several
parties, aggregating about five thousand persons, were brought down by
the troops to the old agency, on Hiwassee, at the present Calhoun,
Tennessee, and to Ross&rsquo;s landing (now Chattanooga), and
Gunter&rsquo;s landing (now Guntersville, Alabama), lower down on the
Tennessee, where they were put upon steamers and transported down the
Tennessee and Ohio to the farther side of the Mississippi, when the
journey was continued by land to Indian Territory. This removal,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>in the hottest part of the year, was attended
with so great sickness and mortality that, by resolution of the
Cherokee national council, Ross and the other chiefs submitted to
General Scott a proposition that the Cherokee be allowed to remove
themselves in the fall, after the sickly season had ended. This was
granted on condition that all should have started by the 20th of
October, excepting the sick and aged who might not be able to move so
rapidly. Accordingly, officers were appointed by the Cherokee council
to take charge of the emigration; the Indians being organized into
detachments averaging one thousand each, with two leaders in charge of
each detachment, and a sufficient number of wagons and horses for the
purpose. In this way the remainder, enrolled at about 13,000 (including
negro slaves), started on the long march overland late in the fall
(44).</p>
<p>Those who thus emigrated under the management of their own officers
assembled at Rattlesnake springs, about two miles south of Hiwassee
river, near the present Charleston, Tennessee, where a final council
was held, in which it was decided to continue their old constitution
and laws in their new home. Then, in October, 1838, the long procession
of exiles was set in motion. A very few went by the river route; the
rest, nearly all of the 13,000, went overland. Crossing to the north
side of the Hiwassee at a ferry above Gunstocker creek, they proceeded
down along the river, the sick, the old people, and the smaller
children, with the blankets, cooking pots, and other belongings in
wagons, the rest on foot or on horses. The number of wagons was
645.</p>
<p>It was like the march of an army, regiment after regiment, the
wagons in the center, the officers along the line and the horsemen on
the flanks and at the rear. Tennessee river was crossed at Tuckers (?)
ferry, a short distance above Jollys island, at the mouth of Hiwassee.
Thence the route lay south of Pikeville, through McMinnville and on to
Nashville, where the Cumberland was crossed. Then they went on to
Hopkinsville, Kentucky, where the noted chief White-path, in charge of
a detachment, sickened and died. His people buried him by the roadside,
with a box over the grave and poles with streamers around it, that the
others coming on behind might note the spot and remember him. Somewhere
also along that march of death&mdash;for the exiles died by tens and
twenties every day of the journey&mdash;the devoted wife of John Ross
sank down, leaving him to go on with the bitter pain of bereavement
added to heartbreak at the ruin of his nation. The Ohio was crossed at
a ferry near the mouth of the Cumberland, and the army passed on
through southern Illinois until the great Mississippi was reached
opposite Cape Girardeau, Missouri. It was now the middle of winter,
with the river running full of ice, so that several detachments were
obliged to wait some time on the eastern bank for the channel to become
clear. In talking with old men <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133"
href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>and women at Tahlequah the
author found that the lapse of over half a century had not sufficed to
wipe out the memory of the miseries of that halt beside the frozen
river, with hundreds of sick and dying penned up in wagons or stretched
upon the ground, with only a blanket overhead to keep out the January
blast. The crossing was made at last in two divisions, at Cape
Girardeau and at Green&rsquo;s ferry, a short distance below, whence
the march was on through Missouri to Indian Territory, the later
detachments making a northerly circuit by Springfield, because those
who had gone before had killed off all the game along the direct route.
At last their destination was reached. They had started in October,
1838, and it was now March, 1839, the journey having occupied nearly
six months of the hardest part of the year.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4621src" href="#xd25e4621" name="xd25e4621src">330</a></p>
<p>It is difficult to arrive at any accurate statement of the number of
Cherokee who died as the result of the Removal. According to the
official figures those who removed under the direction of Ross lost
over 1,600 on the journey.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4626src" href=
"#xd25e4626" name="xd25e4626src">331</a> The proportionate mortality
among those previously removed under military supervision was probably
greater, as it was their suffering that led to the proposition of the
Cherokee national officers to take charge of the emigration. Hundreds
died in the stockades and the waiting camps, chiefly by reason of the
rations furnished, which were of flour and other provisions to which
they were unaccustomed and which they did not know how to prepare
properly. Hundreds of others died soon after their arrival in Indian
territory, from sickness and exposure on the journey. Altogether it is
asserted, probably with reason, that over 4,000 Cherokee died as the
direct result of the removal.</p>
<p>On their arrival in Indian Territory the emigrants at once set about
building houses and planting crops, the government having agreed under
the treaty to furnish them with rations for one year after arrival.
They were welcomed by their kindred, the &ldquo;Arkansas
Cherokee&rdquo;&mdash;hereafter to be known for distinction as the
&ldquo;Old Settlers&rdquo;&mdash;who held the country under previous
treaties in 1828 and 1833. These, however, being already regularly
organized under a government and chiefs of their own, were by no means
disposed to be swallowed by the governmental authority of the
newcomers. Jealousies developed in which the minority or treaty party
of the emigrants, headed by Ridge, took sides with the Old Settlers
against the Ross or national party, which outnumbered both the others
nearly three to one.</p>
<p>While these differences were at their height the Nation was thrown
into a fever of excitement by the news that Major Ridge, his son John
Ridge, and Elias Boudinot&mdash;all leaders of the treaty
party&mdash;had been killed by adherents of the national party,
immediately after the close <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>of a general council, which had
adjourned after nearly two weeks of debate without having been able to
bring about harmonious action. Major Ridge was waylaid and shot close
to the Arkansas line, his son was taken from bed and cut to pieces with
hatchets, while Boudinot was treacherously killed at his home at Park
Hill, Indian territory, all three being killed upon the same day, June
22, 1839.</p>
<p>The agent&rsquo;s report to the Secretary of War, two days later,
says of the affair:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The murder of Boudinot was treacherous and cruel. He
was assisting some workmen in building a new house. Three men called
upon him and asked for medicine. He went off with them in the direction
of Wooster&rsquo;s, the missionary, who keeps medicine, about three
hundred yards from Boudinot&rsquo;s. When they got about half way two
of the men seized Boudinot and the other stabbed him, after which the
three cut him to pieces with their knives and tomahawks. This murder
taking place within two miles of the residence of John Ross, his
friends were apprehensive it might be charged to his connivance; and at
this moment I am writing there are six hundred armed Cherokee around
the dwelling of Ross, assembled for his protection. The murderers of
the two Ridges and Boudinot are certainly of the late Cherokee
emigrants, and, of course, adherents of Ross, but I can not yet believe
that Ross has encouraged the outrage. He is a man of too much good
sense to embroil his nation at this critical time; and besides, his
character, since I have known him, which is now twenty-five years, has
been pacific&#8202;&hellip;. Boudinot&rsquo;s wife is a white woman, a
native of New Jersey, as I understand. He has six children. The wife of
John Ridge, jr., is a white woman, but from whence, or what family
left, I am not informed. Boudinot was in moderate circumstances. The
Ridges, both father and son, were rich&#8202;&hellip;.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e4640src" href="#xd25e4640" name=
"xd25e4640src">332</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While all the evidence shows that Ross was in no way a party to the
affair, there can be no question that the men were killed in accordance
with the law of the Nation&mdash;three times formulated, and still in
existence&mdash;which made it treason, punishable with death, to cede
away lands except by act of the general council of the Nation. It was
for violating a similar law among the Creeks that the chief, McIntosh,
lost his life in 1825, and a party led by Major Ridge himself had
killed Doublehead years before on suspicion of accepting a bribe for
his part in a treaty.</p>
<p>On hearing of the death of the Ridges and Boudinot several other
signers of the repudiated treaty, among whom were John Bell, Archilla
Smith, and James Starr, fled for safety to the protection of the
garrison at Fort Gibson. Boudinot&rsquo;s brother, Stand Watie, vowed
vengeance against Ross, who was urged to flee, but refused, declaring
his entire innocence. His friends rallied to his support, stationing a
guard around his house until the first excitement had subsided. About
three weeks afterward the national council passed decrees declaring
that the men killed and their principal confederates <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>had
rendered themselves outlaws by their own conduct, extending amnesty on
certain stringent conditions to their confederates, and declaring the
slayers guiltless of murder and fully restored to the confidence and
favor of the community. This was followed in August by another council
decree declaring the New Echota treaty void and reasserting the title
of the Cherokee to their old country, and three weeks later another
decree summoned the signers of the treaty to appear and answer for
their conduct under penalty of outlawry. At this point the United
States interfered by threatening to arrest Ross as accessory to the
killing of the Ridges.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4650src" href=
"#xd25e4650" name="xd25e4650src">333</a> In the meantime the national
party and the Old Settlers had been coming together, and a few of the
latter who had sided with the Ridge faction and endeavored to
perpetuate a division in the Nation were denounced in a council of the
Old Settlers, which declared that &ldquo;in identifying themselves with
those individuals known as the Ridge party, who by their conduct had
rendered themselves odious to the Cherokee people, they have acted in
opposition to the known sentiments and feelings of that portion of this
Nation known as Old Settlers, frequently and variously and publicly
expressed.&rdquo; The offending chiefs were at the same time deposed
from all authority. Among the names of over two hundred signers
attached that of &ldquo;George Guess&rdquo; (Sequoya) comes second as
vice-president.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4653src" href="#xd25e4653"
name="xd25e4653src">334</a></p>
<p>On July 12, 1839, a general convention of the eastern and western
Cherokee, held at the Illinois camp ground, Indian territory, passed an
act of union, by which the two were declared &ldquo;one body politic,
under the style and title of the Cherokee Nation.&rdquo; On behalf of
the eastern Cherokee the instrument bears the signature of John Ross,
principal chief, George Lowrey, president of the council, and
Going-snake (I&prime;nad&ucirc;-na&prime;&#301;), speaker of the
council, with thirteen others. For the western Cherokee it was signed
by John Looney, acting principal chief, George Guess (Sequoya),
president of the council, and fifteen others. On September 6, 1839, a
convention composed chiefly of eastern Cherokee assembled at Tahlequah,
Indian territory&mdash;then first officially adopted as the national
capital&mdash;adopted a new constitution, which was accepted by a
convention of the Old Settlers at Fort Gibson, Indian Territory, on
June 26, 1840, an act which completed the reunion of the
Nation.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4658src" href="#xd25e4658" name=

<h4 class="main">THE ARKANSAS BAND&mdash;1817&ndash;1838</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Having followed the fortunes of the main body of the
Nation to their final destination in the West, we now turn to review
briefly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>the history of the earlier emigrants, the
Arkansas or Old Settler Cherokee.</p>
<p>The events leading to the first westward migration and the
subsequent negotiations which resulted in the assignment of a territory
in Arkansas to the western Cherokee, by the treaty of 1817, have been
already noted. The great majority of those thus voluntarily removing
belonged to the conservative hunter element, who desired to reestablish
in the western wilderness the old Indian life from which, through the
influence of schools and intelligent leadership, the body of the
Cherokee was rapidly drifting away. As the lands upon which the
emigrants had settled belonged to the Osage, whose claim had not yet
been extinguished by the United States, the latter objected to their
presence, and the Cherokee were compelled to fight to maintain their
own position, so that for the first twenty years or more the history of
the western band is a mere petty chronicle of Osage raids and Cherokee
retaliations, emphasized from time to time by a massacre on a larger
scale. By the treaty of 1817 the western Cherokee acquired title to a
definite territory and official standing under Government protection
and supervision, the lands assigned them having been acquired by treaty
from the Osage. The great body of the Cherokee in the East were
strongly opposed to any recognition of the western band, seeing in such
action only the beginning of an effort looking toward the ultimate
removal of the whole tribe. The Government lent support to the scheme,
however, and a steady emigration set in until, in 1819, the emigrants
were said to number several thousands. Unsuccessful endeavors were made
to increase the number by inducing the Shawano and Delawares of
Missouri and the Oneida of New York to join them.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>In 1818 Tollunteeskee (Ata&prime;l&ucirc;&ntilde;ti&prime;sk&#301;),
principal chief of the Arkansas Cherokee, while on a visit to old
friends in the East, had become acquainted with one of the officers of
the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, and had asked
for the establishment of a mission among his people in the West. In
response to the invitation the Reverend Cephas Washburn and his
assistant, Reverend Alfred Finney, with their families, set out the
next year from the old Nation, and after a long and exhausting journey
reached the Arkansas country, where, in the spring of 1820, they
established Dwight mission, adjoining the agency at the mouth of
Illinois creek, on the northern bank of the Arkansas, in what is now
Pope county, Arkansas. The name was bestowed in remembrance of Timothy
Dwight, a Yale president and pioneer organizer of the American Board.
Tollunteeskee having died in the meantime was succeeded as principal
chief by his brother, John Jolly,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4675src"
href="#xd25e4675" name="xd25e4675src">337</a> the friend and adopted
father of Samuel Houston. Jolly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137"
href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>had removed from his old home
at the mouth of Hiwassee, in Tennessee, in 1818.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>In the spring of 1819 Thomas Nuttall, the naturalist, ascended the
Arkansas, and he gives an interesting account of the western Cherokee
as he found them at the time. In going up the stream, &ldquo;both banks
of the river, as we proceeded, were lined with the houses and farms of
the Cherokee, and though their dress was a mixture of indigenous and
European taste, yet in their houses, which are decently furnished, and
in their farms, which were well fenced and stocked with cattle, we
perceive a happy approach toward civilization. Their numerous families,
also, well fed and clothed, argue a propitious progress in their
population. Their superior industry either as hunters or farmers proves
the value of property among them, and they are no longer strangers to
avarice and the distinctions created by wealth. Some of them are
possessed of property to the amount of many thousands of dollars, have
houses handsomely and conveniently furnished, and their tables spread
with our dainties and luxuries.&rdquo; He mentions an engagement some
time before between them and the Osage, in which the Cherokee had
killed nearly one hundred of the Osage, besides taking a number of
prisoners. He estimates them at about fifteen hundred, being about half
the number estimated by the eastern Nation as having emigrated to the
West, and only one-fourth of the official estimate. A few Delawares
were living with them.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4685src" href=
"#xd25e4685" name="xd25e4685src">339</a></p>
<p>The Osage troubles continued in spite of a treaty of peace between
the two tribes made at a council held under the direction of Governor
Clark at St. Louis, in October, 1818.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4690src" href="#xd25e4690" name="xd25e4690src">340</a> Warriors
from the eastern Cherokee were accustomed to make the long journey to
the Arkansas to assist their western brethren, and returned with scalps
and captives.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4693src" href="#xd25e4693"
name="xd25e4693src">341</a></p>
<p>In the summer of 1820 a second effort for peace was made by Governor
Miller of Arkansas territory. In reply to his talk the Osage complained
that the Cherokee had failed to deliver their Osage captives as
stipulated in the previous agreement at St. Louis. This, it appears,
was due in part to the fact that some of these captives had been
carried to the eastern Cherokee, and a messenger was accordingly
dispatched to secure and bring them back. Another peace conference was
held soon afterward at Fort Smith, but to very little purpose, as
hostilities were soon resumed and continued until the United States
actively interposed in the fall of 1822.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4698src" href="#xd25e4698" name="xd25e4698src">342</a></p>
<p>In this year also Sequoya visited the western Cherokee to introduce
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>to them the knowledge of his great invention,
which was at once taken up through the influence of Takatoka
(Degat&acirc;&prime;ga), a prominent chief who had hitherto opposed
every effort of the missionaries to introduce their own schools and
religion. In consequence perhaps of this encouragement Sequoya removed
permanently to the West in the following year and became henceforth a
member of the western Nation.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4711src" href=
"#xd25e4711" name="xd25e4711src">343</a></p>
<p>Like other Indians, the western Cherokee held a firm belief in
witchcraft, which led to frequent tragedies of punishment or
retaliation. In 1824 a step forward was marked by the enactment of a
law making it murder to kill any one for witchcraft, and an offense
punishable with whipping to accuse another of witchcraft.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e4716src" href="#xd25e4716" name=
"xd25e4716src">344</a> This law may have been the result of the silent
working of missionary influence, supported by such enlightened men as
Sequoya.</p>
<p>The treaty which assigned the Arkansas lands to the western Cherokee
had stipulated that a census should be made of the eastern and western
divisions of the Nation, separately, and an apportionment of the
national annuity forthwith made on that basis. The western line of the
Arkansas tract had also been left open, until according to another
stipulation of the same treaty, the whole amount of land ceded through
it to the United States by the Cherokee Nation in the East could be
ascertained in order that an equal quantity might be included within
the boundaries of the western tract.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4721src" href="#xd25e4721" name="xd25e4721src">345</a> These
promises had not yet been fulfilled, partly because of the efforts of
the Government to bring about a larger emigration or a further cession,
partly on account of delay in the state surveys, and partly also
because the Osage objected to the running of a line which should make
the Cherokee their next door neighbors.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4724src" href="#xd25e4724" name="xd25e4724src">346</a> With their
boundaries unadjusted and their annuities withheld, distress and
dissatisfaction overcame the western Cherokee, many of whom, feeling
themselves absolved from territorial restrictions, spread over the
country on the southern side of Arkansas river,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4727src" href="#xd25e4727" name="xd25e4727src">347</a> while
others, under the lead of a chief named The Bowl
(Diwa&prime;&#699;l&#301;), crossed Red river into Texas&mdash;then a
portion of Mexico&mdash;in a vain attempt to escape American
jurisdiction.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4730src" href="#xd25e4730"
name="xd25e4730src">348</a></p>
<p>A provisional western boundary having been run, which proved
unsatisfactory both to the western Cherokee and to the people of
Arkansas, an effort was made to settle the difficulty by arranging an
exchange of the Arkansas tract for a new country west of the Arkansas
line. So strongly opposed, however, were the western Cherokee to this
project that their council, in 1825, passed a law, as the eastern
Cherokee and the Creeks had already done, fixing the death penalty
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>for anyone of the tribe who should undertake to
cede or exchange land belonging to the Nation.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4740src" href="#xd25e4740" name="xd25e4740src">349</a></p>
<p>After a long series of negotiations such pressure was brought to
bear upon a delegation which visited Washington in 1828 that consent
was at last obtained to an exchange of the Arkansas tract for another
piece of seven million acres lying farther west, together with &ldquo;a
perpetual outlet west&rdquo; of the tract thus assigned, as far west as
the sovereignty of the United States might extend.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e4746src" href="#xd25e4746" name="xd25e4746src">350</a> The
boundaries given for this seven-million-acre tract and the adjoining
western outlet were modified by treaty at Fort Gibson five years later
so as to be practically equivalent to the present territory of the
Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory, with the Cherokee strip recently
ceded.</p>
<p>The preamble of the Washington treaty of May 6, 1828, recites that
&ldquo;Whereas, it being the anxious desire of the Government of the
United States to secure to the Cherokee nation of Indians, as well
those now living within the limits of the territory of Arkansas as
those of their friends and brothers who reside in states east of the
Mississippi, and who may wish to join their brothers of the West, <i>a
permanent home</i>, and which shall, under the most solemn guarantee of
the United States, be and remain theirs forever&mdash;a home that shall
never, in all future time, be embarrassed by having extended around it
the lines or placed over it the jurisdiction of a territory or state,
nor be pressed upon by the extension in any way of any of the limits of
any existing territory or state; and whereas the present location of
the Cherokees in Arkansas being unfavorable to their present repose,
and tending, as the past demonstrates, to their future degradation and
misery, and the Cherokees being anxious to avoid such
consequences,&rdquo; etc.&mdash;therefore, they cede everything
confirmed to them in 1817.</p>
<p>Article 2 defines the boundaries of the new tract and the western
outlet to be given in exchange, lying immediately west of the present
Arkansas line, while the next article provides for the removal of all
whites and others residing within the said boundaries, &ldquo;so that
no obstacles arising out of the presence of a white population, or any
population of any other sort, shall exist to annoy the Cherokees, and
also to keep all such from the west of said line in future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other articles provide for payment for improvements left behind; for
a cash sum of $50,000 to pay for trouble and expense of removal and to
compensate for the inferior quality of the lands in the new tract; for
$6,000 to pay for recovering stock which may stray away &ldquo;in quest
of the pastures from which they may be driven;&rdquo; $8,760 for
spoliations committed by Osage and whites; $500 to George Guess
(Sequoya)&mdash;who was himself one of the signers&mdash;in
consideration of the beneficial results to his tribe from the alphabet
invented by him; $20,000 in ten annual payments for education; $1,000
for a printing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>press and type to aid in the enlightenment of
the people &ldquo;in their own and our language&rdquo;; a personal
indemnity for false imprisonment; and for the removal and
reestablishment of the Dwight mission.</p>
<p>In article 6 &ldquo;it is moreover agreed by the United States,
whenever the Cherokee may desire it, to give them a set of plain laws,
suited to their condition; also, when they wish to lay off their lands
and own them individually, a surveyor shall be sent to make the surveys
at the cost of the United States.&rdquo; This article was annulled in
1833 by request of the Cherokee.</p>
<p>Article 9 provides for the Fort Gibson military reservation within
the new tract, while article 7 binds the Cherokee to surrender and
remove from all their lands in Arkansas within fourteen months.</p>
<p>Article 8 shows that all this was intended to be only preliminary to
the removal of the whole Cherokee Nation from the east of the
Mississippi, a consummation toward which the Jackson administration and
the state of Georgia immediately began to bend every effort. It is as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Article 8.</span> The Cherokee
nation, west of the Mississippi, having by this agreement freed
themselves from the harassing and ruinous effects consequent upon a
location amidst a white population, and secured to themselves and their
posterity, under the solemn sanction of the guarantee of the United
States as contained in this agreement, a large extent of unembarrassed
country; and that their brothers yet remaining in the states may be
induced to join them and enjoy the repose and blessings of such a state
in the future, it is further agreed on the part of the United States
that to each head of a Cherokee family now residing within the
chartered limits of Georgia, or of either of the states east of the
Mississippi, who may desire to remove west, shall be given, on
enrolling himself for emigration, a good rifle, a blanket, a kettle,
and five pounds of tobacco; (and to each member of his family one
blanket), also a just compensation for the property he may abandon, to
be assessed by persons to be appointed by the President of the United
States. The cost of the emigration of all such shall also be borne by
the United States, and good and suitable ways opened and procured for
their comfort, accommodation, and support by the way, and provisions
for twelve months after their arrival at the agency; and to each
person, or head of a family, if he take along with him four persons,
shall be paid immediately on his arriving at the agency and reporting
himself and his family or followers as emigrants or permanent settlers,
in addition to the above, <i>provided he and they shall have emigrated
from within the chartered limits of the State of Georgia</i>, the sum
of fifty dollars, and this sum in proportion to any greater or less
number that may accompany him from within the aforesaid chartered
limits of the State of Georgia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Senate amendment, defining the limits of the western outlet, was
afterward found to be impracticable in its restrictions and was
canceled by the treaty made at Fort Gibson in 1833.<a class="noteref"

<p>The Washington treaty was signed by several delegates, including
Sequoya, four of them signing in Cherokee characters. As the laws
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>of the western Cherokee made it a capital
offense to negotiate any sale or exchange of land excepting by
authority of council, and the delegates had acted without such
authority, they were so doubtful as to what might happen on their
return that the Secretary of War sent with them a letter of explanation
assuring the Cherokee that their representatives had acted with
integrity and earnest zeal for their people and had done the best that
could be done with regard to the treaty. Notwithstanding this, they
found the whole tribe so strongly opposed to the treaty that their own
lives and property were unsafe. The national council pronounced them
guilty of fraud and deception and declared the treaty null and void, as
having been made without authority, and asked permission to send on a
delegation authorized to arrange all differences.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4798src" href="#xd25e4798" name="xd25e4798src">352</a> In the
meantime, however, the treaty had been ratified within three weeks of
its conclusion, and thus, hardly ten years after they had cleared their
fields on the Arkansas, the western Cherokee were forced to abandon
their cabins and plantations and move once more into the
wilderness.</p>
<p>A considerable number, refusing to submit to the treaty or to trust
longer to guarantees and promises, crossed Red river into Texas and
joined the Cherokee colony already located there by The Bowl, under
Mexican jurisdiction. Among those thus removing was the noted chief
Tahchee (T&#259;ts&#301;) or &ldquo;Dutch,&rdquo; who had been one of
the earliest emigrants to the Arkansas country. After several years in
Texas, during which he led war parties against the wilder tribes, he
recrossed Red river and soon made himself so conspicuous in raids upon
the Osage that a reward of five hundred dollars was offered by General
Arbuckle for his capture. To show his defiance of the proclamation, he
deliberately journeyed to Fort Gibson, attacked a party of Osage at a
trading post near by, and scalped one of them within hearing of the
drums of the fort. With rifle in one hand and the bleeding scalp in the
other, he leaped a precipice and made his escape, although a bullet
grazed his cheek. On promise of amnesty and the withdrawal of the
reward, he afterward returned and settled, with his followers, on the
Canadian, southwest of Fort Gibson, establishing a reputation among
army officers as a valuable scout and guide.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4803src" href="#xd25e4803" name="xd25e4803src">353</a></p>
<p>By treaties made in 1826 and 1827 the Creeks had ceded all their
remaining lands in Georgia and agreed to remove to Indian Territory.
Some of these emigrants had settled along the northern bank of the
Arkansas and on Verdigris river, on lands later found to be within the
limits of the territory assigned to the western Cherokee by the treaty
of 1828. This led to jealousies and collisions between <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>the
two tribes, and in order to settle the difficulty the United States
convened a joint council of Creeks and Cherokee at Fort Gibson, with
the result that separate treaties were concluded with each on February
14, 1833, defining their respective bounds to the satisfaction of all
concerned. By this arrangement the upper Verdigris was confirmed to the
Cherokee, and the Creeks who had settled along that portion of the
stream agreed to remove to Creek territory immediately adjoining on the
south.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4817src" href="#xd25e4817" name=
"xd25e4817src">354</a></p>
<p>By the treaty made on this occasion with the Cherokee the boundaries
of the tract of seven million acres granted by the treaty of 1828 are
defined so as to correspond with the present boundaries of the Cherokee
country in Indian territory, together with a strip two miles wide along
the northern border, which was afterward annexed to the state of Kansas
by the treaty of 1866. A tract in the northeastern corner, between
Neosho or Grand river and the Missouri line, was set apart for the use
of the Seneca and several other remnants of tribes removed from their
original territories. The western outlet established by the treaty of
1828 was reestablished as a western extension from the
seven-million-acre tract thus bounded, being what was afterward known
as the Cherokee strip or outlet plus the two-mile strip extending
westward along the south line of Kansas.</p>
<p>After describing the boundaries of the main residence tract, the
first article continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In addition to the seven millions of acres of land
thus provided for and bounded the United States further guarantee to
the Cherokee nation a perpetual outlet west and a free and unmolested
use of all the country lying west of the western boundary of said seven
millions of acres, as far west as the sovereignty of the United States
and their right of soil extend&mdash;provided, however, that if the
saline or salt plain on the great western prairie shall fall within
said limits prescribed for said outlet the right is reserved to the
United States to permit other tribes of red men to get salt on said
plain in common with the Cherokees&mdash;and letters patent shall be
issued by the United States as soon as practicable for the lands hereby
guaranteed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third article cancels, at the particular request of the
Cherokee, that article of the treaty of 1828 by which the government
was to give to the Cherokee a set of laws and a surveyor to survey
lands for individuals, when so desired by the Cherokee.<a class=

<p>Their differences with the Creeks having been thus adjusted, the
Arkansas Cherokee proceeded to occupy the territory guaranteed to them,
where they were joined a few years later by their expatriated kinsmen
from the east. By tacit agreement some of the Creeks who had settled
within the Cherokee bounds were permitted to remain. Among these were
several families of Uchee&mdash;an incorporated tribe <span class=

<h4 class="main">THE TEXAS BAND&mdash;1817&ndash;1900</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As already stated, a band of western Cherokee under
Chief Bowl, dissatisfied with the delay in fulfilling the terms of the
treaty of 1817, had left Arkansas and crossed Red river into Texas,
then under Mexican jurisdiction, where they were joined a few years
later by Tahchee and others of the western band who were opposed to the
treaty of 1828. Here they united with other refugee Indians from the
United States, forming together a loose confederacy known afterward as
&ldquo;the Cherokee and their associated bands,&rdquo; consisting of
Cherokee, Shawano, Delaware, Kickapoo, Quapaw, Choctaw, Biloxi,
&ldquo;Iawanie&rdquo; (Heyowani, Yowani), &ldquo;Unataqua&rdquo;
(Nada&prime;ko or Anadarko, another Caddo subtribe),
&ldquo;Tahookatookie&rdquo; (?), Alabama (a Creek subtribe), and
&ldquo;Cooshatta&rdquo; (Koasa&prime;ti, another Creek subtribe). The
Cherokee being the largest and most important band, their chief,
Bowl&mdash;known to the whites as Colonel Bowles&mdash;was regarded as
the chief and principal man of them all.</p>
<p>The refugees settled chiefly along Angelina, Neches, and Trinity
rivers in eastern Texas, where Bowl endeavored to obtain a grant of
land for their use from the Mexican government. According to the Texan
historians they were tacitly permitted to occupy the country and hopes
were held out that a grant would be issued, but the papers had not been
perfected when the Texas revolution began.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4857src" href="#xd25e4857" name="xd25e4857src">357</a> According
to the Cherokee statement the grant was actually issued and the Spanish
document inclosed in a tin box was on the person of Bowl when he was
killed.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4860src" href="#xd25e4860" name=
"xd25e4860src">358</a> On complaint of some of the American colonists
in Texas President Jackson issued a proclamation forbidding any Indians
to cross the Sabine river from the United States.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4866src" href="#xd25e4866" name="xd25e4866src">359</a></p>
<p>In 1826&ndash;27 a dissatisfied American colony in eastern Texas,
under the leadership of Hayden Edwards, organized what was known as the
&ldquo;Fredonia rebellion&rdquo; against the Mexican government. To
secure the alliance of the Cherokee and their confederates the
Americans entered into a treaty by which the Indians were guaranteed
the lands <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>occupied by them, but without specification as
to boundaries. The Fredonia movement soon collapsed and nothing
tangible seems to have come of the negotiations.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4875src" href="#xd25e4875" name="xd25e4875src">360</a></p>
<p>In the fall of 1835 the Texan revolution began, resulting in the
secession of Texas from Mexico and her establishment as an independent
republic until annexed later to the United States. General Samuel
Houston, a leading member of the revolutionary body, was an old friend
of the Cherokee, and set forth so strongly the claims of them and their
confederates that an act was passed by the convention pledging to these
tribes all the lands which they had held under the Mexican government.
In accordance with this act General Houston and John Forbes were
appointed to hold a treaty with the Cherokee and their associated
bands. They met the chiefs, including Bowl and Big-mush
(Gat&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;wa&#699;l&#301;, &ldquo;Hard-mush&rdquo;), of
the Cherokee, at Bowl&rsquo;s village on February 23, 1836, and
concluded a formal treaty by which the Cherokee and their allies
received a fee simple title to all the land lying &ldquo;west of the
San Antonio road and beginning on the west at a point where the said
road crosses the river Angelina, and running up said river until it
reaches the mouth of the first large creek below the great Shawnee
village, emptying into the said river from the northeast, thence
running with said creek to its main source and from thence a due north
line to the Sabine and with said river west. Then starting where the
San Antonio road crosses the Angelina and with said road to where it
crosses the Neches and thence running up the east side of said river in
a northwest direction.&rdquo; The historian remarks that the
description is somewhat vague, but is a literal transcription from the
treaty.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4880src" href="#xd25e4880" name=
"xd25e4880src">361</a> The territory thus assigned was about equivalent
to the present Cherokee county, Texas.</p>
<p>The treaty provoked such general dissatisfaction among the Texans
that it was not presented to the convention for ratification. General
Houston became President of Texas in November, 1836, but
notwithstanding all his efforts in behalf of the Cherokee, the treaty
was rejected by the Texas senate in secret session on December 16,
1837.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4885src" href="#xd25e4885" name=
"xd25e4885src">362</a> Texas having in the meantime achieved victorious
independence was now in position to repudiate her engagements with the
Indians, which she did, not only with the Cherokee, but with the
Comanche and other wild tribes, which had been induced to remain
neutral during the struggle on assurance of being secured in possession
of their lands.</p>
<p>In the meantime President Houston was unremitting in his effort to
secure the ratification of the Cherokee treaty, but without success. On
the other hand the Cherokee were accused of various depredations, and
it was asserted that they had entered into an agreement with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>Mexico by which they were to be secured in the
territory in question on condition of assisting to drive out the
Americans.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4892src" href="#xd25e4892" name=
"xd25e4892src">363</a> The charge came rather late in the day, and it
was evident that President Houston put no faith in it, as he still
continued his efforts in behalf of the Cherokee, even so far as to
order the boundary line to be run, according to the terms of the treaty

<p>In December, 1838, Houston was succeeded as President by Mirabeau B.
Lamar, who at once announced his intention to expel every Indian tribe
from Texas, declaring in his inaugural message that &ldquo;the sword
should mark the boundaries of the republic.&rdquo; At this time the
Indians in eastern Texas, including the Cherokee and their twelve
confederated bands and some others, were estimated at 1,800 warriors,
or perhaps 8,000 persons.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4900src" href=
"#xd25e4900" name="xd25e4900src">365</a></p>
<p>A small force of troops sent to take possession of the salt springs
in the Indian country at the head of the Neches was notified by Bowl
that such action would be resisted. The Indians were then informed that
they must prepare to leave the country in the fall, but that they would
be paid for the improvements abandoned. In the meantime the neighboring
Mexicans made an effort to free themselves from Texan rule and sent
overtures to the Indians to make common cause with them. This being
discovered, the crisis was precipitated, and a commission consisting of
General Albert Sidney Johnston (secretary of war of the republic),
Vice-President Burnet, and some other officials, backed up by several
regiments of troops, was sent to the Cherokee village on Angelina river
to demand of the Indians that they remove at once across the border.
The Indians refused and were attacked and defeated on July 15, 1839, by
the Texan troops under command of General Douglas. They were pursued
and a second engagement took place the next morning, resulting in the
death of Bowl himself and his assistant chief
Gat&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;wa&#699;l&#301;, &ldquo;Hard-mush,&rdquo; and
the dispersion of the Indian forces, with a loss in the two engagements
of about 55 killed and 80 wounded, the Texan loss being comparatively
trifling. The first fight took place at a hill close to the main
Cherokee village on the Angelina, where the Indians made a stand and
defended their position well for some time. The second occurred at a
ravine near Neches river, where they were intercepted in their retreat.
Says Thrall, &ldquo;After this fight the Indians abandoned Texas,
leaving their fine lands in possession of the whites.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>By these two defeats the forces of the Cherokee and their
confederates were completely broken up. A part of the Cherokee
recrossed Red river and rejoined their kinsmen in Indian territory,
bringing with them the blood-stained canister containing the patent for
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>Texas land, which Bowl had carried about with
him since the treaty with Houston and which he had upon his person when
shot. It is still kept in the Nation.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4912src" href="#xd25e4912" name="xd25e4912src">367</a> Others,
with the Kickapoo, Delawares, and Caddo, scattered in small bands along
the western Texas frontier, where they were occasionally heard from
afterward. On Christmas day of the same year a fight occurred on
Cherokee creek, San Saba county, in which several Indians were killed
and a number of women and children captured, including the wife and
family of the dead chief Bowl.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4915src"
href="#xd25e4915" name="xd25e4915src">368</a> Those of the Cherokee who
did not return to Indian territory gradually drifted down into Mexico,
where some hundreds of them are now permanently and prosperously
domiciled far south in the neighborhood of Guadalajara and Lake
Chapala, communication being still kept up through occasional visits
from their kinsmen in the territory.<a class="noteref" id=

WEST&mdash;1840&ndash;1900</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With the final removal of the Cherokee from their
native country and their reunion and reorganization under new
conditions in Indian Territory in 1840 their aboriginal period properly
comes to a close and the rest may be dismissed in a few paragraphs as
of concern rather to the local historian than to the ethnologist.
Having traced for three full centuries their gradual evolution from a
savage tribe to a civilized Christian nation, with a national
constitution and national press printed in their own national alphabet,
we can afford to leave the rest to others, the principal materials
being readily accessible in the Cherokee national archives at
Tahlequah, in the files of the <i>Cherokee Advocate</i> and other
newspapers published in the Nation, and in the annual reports and other
documents of the Indian office.</p>
<p>For many years the hunter and warrior had been giving place to the
farmer and mechanic, and the forced expatriation made the change
complete and final. Torn from their native streams and mountains, their
council fires extinguished and their townhouses burned behind them, and
transported bodily to a far distant country where everything was new
and strange, they were obliged perforce to forego the old life and
adjust themselves to changed surroundings. The ballplay was neglected
and the green-corn dance proscribed, while the heroic tradition of
former days became a fading memory or a tale to amuse a child. Instead
of ceremonials and peace councils we hear now of railroad deals and
contracts with cattle syndicates, and instead of the old warrior chiefs
who had made the Cherokee name a terror&mdash;Oconostota, Hanging-maw,
Doublehead, and Pathkiller&mdash;we find the destinies of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>nation guided henceforth by shrewd mixed-blood
politicians, bearing white men&rsquo;s names and speaking the white
man&rsquo;s language, and frequently with hardly enough Indian blood to
show itself in the features.</p>
<p>The change was not instantaneous, nor is it even yet complete, for
although the tendency is constantly away from the old things, and
although frequent intermarriages are rapidly bleaching out the brown of
the Indian skin, there are still several thousand full-blood
Cherokee&mdash;enough to constitute a large tribe if set off by
themselves&mdash;who speak only their native language and in secret bow
down to the nature-gods of their fathers. Here, as in other lands, the
conservative element has taken refuge in the mountain districts, while
the mixed-bloods and the adopted whites are chiefly on the richer low
grounds and in the railroad towns.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>On the reorganization of the united Nation the council ground at
Tahlequah was designated as the seat of government, and the present
town was soon afterward laid out upon the spot, taking its name from
the old Cherokee town of T&#259;likw&#259;&prime;, or Tellico, in
Tennessee. The missions were reestablished, the <i>Advocate</i> was
revived, and the work of civilization was again taken up, though under
great difficulties, as continued removals and persecutions, with the
awful suffering and mortality of the last great emigration, had
impoverished and more than decimated the Nation and worn out the
courage even of the bravest. The bitterness engendered by the New
Echota treaty led to a series of murders and assassinations and other
acts of outlawry, amounting almost to civil war between the Ross and
Ridge factions, until the Government was at last obliged to interfere.
The Old Settlers also had their grievances and complaints against the
newcomers, so that the history of the Cherokee Nation for the next
twenty years is largely a chronicle of factional quarrels, through
which civilization and every good work actually retrograded behind the
condition of a generation earlier.</p>
<p>Sequoya, who had occupied a prominent position in the affairs of the
Old Settlers and assisted much in the reorganization of the Nation, had
become seized with a desire to make linguistic investigations among the
remote tribes, very probably with a view of devising a universal Indian
alphabet. His mind dwelt also on the old tradition of a lost band of
Cherokee living somewhere toward the western mountains. In 1841 and
1842, with a few Cherokee companions and with his provisions and papers
loaded in an ox cart, he made several journeys into the West, received
everywhere with kindness by even the wildest tribes. Disappointed in
his philologic results, he started out in 1843 in quest of the lost
Cherokee, who were believed to be somewhere in northern Mexico, but,
being now an old man and worn out by hardship, he sank under the effort
and died&mdash;alone and unattended, it is said&mdash;near the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>village of San Fernando, Mexico, in August of
that year. Rumors having come of his helpless condition, a party had
been sent out from the Nation to bring him back, but arrived too late
to find him alive. A pension of three hundred dollars, previously voted
to him by the Nation, was continued to his widow&mdash;the only
literary pension in the United States. Besides a wife he left two sons
and a daughter.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4946src" href="#xd25e4946"
name="xd25e4946src">370</a> Sequoyah district of the Cherokee Nation
was named in his honor, and the great trees of California (<i>Sequoia
gigantea</i>) also preserve his memory.</p>
<p>In 1846 a treaty was concluded at Washington by which the
conflicting claims of the Old Settlers and later emigrants were
adjusted, reimbursement was promised for sums unjustly deducted from
the five-million-dollar payment guaranteed under the treaty of 1835,
and a general amnesty was proclaimed for all past offenses within the
Nation.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4954src" href="#xd25e4954" name=
"xd25e4954src">371</a> Final settlement of the treaty claims has not
yet been made, and the matter is still a subject of litigation,
including all the treaties and agreements up to the present date.</p>
<p>In 1859 the devoted missionary Samuel Worcester, author of numerous
translations and first organizer of the <i>Advocate</i>, died at Park
Hill mission, in the Cherokee Nation, after thirty-five years spent in
the service of the Cherokee, having suffered chains, imprisonment, and
exile for their sake.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4962src" href=
"#xd25e4962" name="xd25e4962src">372</a></p>
<p>The breaking out of the civil war in 1861 found the Cherokee divided
in sentiment. Being slave owners, like the other Indians removed from
the southern states, and surrounded by southern influences, the agents
in charge being themselves southern sympathizers, a considerable party
in each of the tribes was disposed to take active part with the
Confederacy. The old Ridge party, headed by Stand Watie and supported
by the secret secession organization known as the Knights of the Golden
Circle, declared for the Confederacy. The National party, headed by
John Ross and supported by the patriotic organization known as the
Kitoowah society&mdash;whose members were afterward known as Pin
Indians&mdash;declared for strict neutrality. At last, however, the
pressure became too strong to be resisted, and on October 7, 1861, a
treaty was concluded at Tahlequah, with General Albert Pike,
commissioner for the Confederate states, by which the Cherokee Nation
cast its lot with the Confederacy, as the Creeks, Choctaw, Chickasaw,
Seminole, Osage, Comanche, and several smaller tribes had already
done.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4967src" href="#xd25e4967" name=
"xd25e4967src">373</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span></p>
<p>Two Cherokee regiments were raised for the Confederate service,
under command of Stand Watie and Colonel Drew, respectively, the former
being commissioned as brigadier-general. They participated in several
engagements, chief among them being the battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas,
on March 7, 1862.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4976src" href="#xd25e4976"
name="xd25e4976src">374</a> In the following summer the Union forces
entered the Cherokee country and sent a proposition to Ross, urging him
to repudiate the treaty with the Confederate states, but the offer was
indignantly declined. Shortly afterward, however, the men of
Drew&rsquo;s regiment, finding themselves unpaid and generally
neglected by their allies, went over almost in a body to the Union
side, thus compelling Ross to make an arrangement with the Union
commander, Colonel Weir. Leaving the Cherokee country, Ross retired to
Philadelphia, from which he did not return until the close of the
war.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4979src" href="#xd25e4979" name=
"xd25e4979src">375</a> In the meantime Indian Territory was ravaged
alternately by contending factions and armed bodies, and thousands of
loyal fugitives were obliged to take refuge in Kansas, where they were
cared for by the government. Among these, at the close of 1862, were
two thousand Cherokee. In the following spring they were sent back to
their homes under armed escort to give them an opportunity to put in a
crop, seeds and tools being furnished for the purpose, but had hardly
begun work when they were forced to retire by the approach of Stand
Watie and his regiment of Confederate Cherokee, estimated at seven
hundred men. Stand Watie and his men, with the Confederate Creeks and
others, scoured the country at will, destroying or carrying off
everything belonging to the loyal Cherokee, who had now, to the number
of nearly seven thousand, taken refuge at Fort Gibson. Refusing to take
sides against a government which was still unable to protect them, they
were forced to see all the prosperous accumulations of twenty years of
industry swept off in this guerrilla warfare. In stock alone their
losses were estimated at more than 300,000 head.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4982src" href="#xd25e4982" name="xd25e4982src">376</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The events of the war brought to them more of desolation and
ruin than perhaps to any other community. Raided and sacked
alternately, not only by the Confederate and Union forces, but by the
vindictive ferocity and hate of their own factional divisions, their
country became a blackened and desolate waste. Driven from comfortable
homes, exposed to want, misery, and the elements, they perished like
sheep in a snow storm. Their houses, fences, and other improvements
were burned, their orchards destroyed, their flocks and herds
slaughtered or driven off, their schools broken up, their schoolhouses
given to the flames, and their churches and public buildings subjected
to a similar fate; and that entire portion of their country which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>had been occupied by their settlements was
distinguishable from the virgin prairie only by the scorched and
blackened chimneys and the plowed but now neglected
fields.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4989src" href="#xd25e4989"
name="xd25e4989src">377</a></p>
<p>After five years of desolation the Cherokee emerged from the war
with their numbers reduced from 21,000 to 14,000,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4995src" href="#xd25e4995" name="xd25e4995src">378</a> and their
whole country in ashes. On July 19, 1866, by a treaty concluded at
Tahlequah, the nation was received back into the protection of the
United States, a general amnesty was proclaimed, and all confiscations
on account of the war prohibited; slavery was abolished without
compensation to former owners, and all negroes residing within the
Nation were admitted to full Cherokee citizenship. By articles 15 and
16 permission was given the United States to settle friendly Indians
within the Cherokee home country or the Cherokee strip by consent and
purchase from the Nation. By article 17 the Cherokee sold the
800,000-acre tract in Kansas secured by the treaty of 1835, together
with a two-mile strip running along the southern border of Kansas, and
thereafter to be included within the limits of that state, thus leaving
the Cherokee country as it was before the recent cession of the
Cherokee strip. Payment was promised for spoliations by United States
troops during the war; and $3,000 were to be paid out of the Cherokee
funds to the Reverend Evan Jones, then disabled and in poverty, as a
reward for forty years of faithful missionary labors. By article 26
&ldquo;the United States guarantee to the Cherokees the quiet and
peaceable possession of their country and protection against domestic
feuds and insurrection as well as hostilities of other tribes. They
shall also be protected from intrusion by all unauthorized citizens of
the United States attempting to settle on their lands or reside in
their territory.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4998src" href=
"#xd25e4998" name="xd25e4998src">379</a></p>
<p>The missionary, Reverend Evan Jones, who had followed the Cherokee
into exile, and his son, John B. Jones, had been admitted to Cherokee
citizenship the year before by vote of the Nation. The act conferring
this recognition recites that &ldquo;we do bear witness that they have
done their work well.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5003src" href=
"#xd25e5003" name="xd25e5003src">380</a></p>
<p>John Ross, now an old man, had been unable to attend this treaty,
being present at the time in Washington on business for his people.
Before its ratification he died in that city on August 1, 1866, at the
age of seventy-seven years, fifty-seven of which had been given to the
service of his Nation. No finer panegyric was ever pronounced than the
memorial resolution passed by the Cherokee Nation on learning of his
death.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5008src" href="#xd25e5008" name=
"xd25e5008src">381</a> Notwithstanding repeated attempts to subvert his
authority, his people had remained steadfast in their fidelity to him,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>and he died, as he had lived for nearly forty
years, the officially recognized chief of the Nation. With repeated
opportunities to enrich himself at the expense of his tribe, he died a
poor man. His body was brought back and interred in the territory of
the Nation. In remembrance of the great chief one of the nine districts
of the Cherokee Nation has been called by his Indian name,
Cooweescoowee (46).</p>

<p>Under the provisions of the late treaty the Delawares in Kansas, to
the number of 985, removed to Indian territory in 1867 and became
incorporated as citizens of the Cherokee Nation. They were followed in
1870 by the Shawano, chiefly also from Kansas, to the number of
770.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5026src" href="#xd25e5026" name=
"xd25e5026src">382</a> These immigrants settled chiefly along the
Verdigris, in the northwestern part of the Nation. Under the same
treaty the Osage, Kaw, Pawnee, Ponca, Oto and Missouri, and Tonkawa
were afterward settled on the western extension known then as the
Cherokee strip. The captive Nez Perc&eacute;s of Joseph&rsquo;s band
were also temporarily located there, but have since been removed to the
states of Washington and Idaho.</p>
<p>In 1870 the Missouri, Kansas and Texas railway, a branch of the
Union Pacific system, was constructed through the lands of the Cherokee
Nation under an agreement ratified by the Government, it being the
first railroad to enter that country.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5031src" href="#xd25e5031" name="xd25e5031src">383</a> Several
others have since been constructed or projected.</p>
<p>The same year saw a Cherokee literary revival. The publication of
the <i>Advocate</i>, which had been suspended since some years before
the war, was resumed, and by authority of the Nation John B. Jones
began the preparation of a series of schoolbooks in the Cherokee
language and alphabet for the benefit of those children who knew no
English.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5039src" href="#xd25e5039" name=
"xd25e5039src">384</a></p>
<p>In the spring of 1881 a delegation from the Cherokee Nation visited
the East Cherokee still remaining in the mountains of North Carolina
and extended to them a cordial and urgent invitation to remove and
incorporate upon equal terms with the Cherokee Nation in the Indian
territory. In consequence several parties of East Cherokee, numbering
in all 161 persons, removed during the year to the western Nation, the
expense being paid by the Federal government. Others afterwards applied
for assistance to remove, but as no further appropriation was made for
the purpose nothing more was done.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5044src"
href="#xd25e5044" name="xd25e5044src">385</a> In 1883 the East Cherokee
brought suit for a proportionate division of the Cherokee funds and
other interests under previous treaties,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5047src" href="#xd25e5047" name="xd25e5047src">386</a> but their
claim was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>finally decided adversely three years later on
appeal to the Supreme Court.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5052src" href=
"#xd25e5052" name="xd25e5052src">387</a></p>
<p>In 1889 the Cherokee female seminary was completed at Tahlequah at a
cost of over $60,000, supplementing the work of the male seminary,
built some years before at a cost of $90,000. The Cherokee Nation was
now appropriating annually over $80,000 for school purposes, including
the support of the two seminaries, an orphan asylum, and over one
hundred primary schools, besides which there were a number of mission
schools.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5057src" href="#xd25e5057" name=
"xd25e5057src">388</a></p>
<p>For a number of years the pressure for the opening of Indian
territory to white settlement had been growing in strength. Thousands
of intruders had settled themselves upon the lands of each of the five
civilized tribes, where they remained upon various pretexts in spite of
urgent and repeated appeals to the government by the Indians for their
removal. Under treaties with the five civilized tribes, the right to
decide citizenship or residence claims belonged to the tribes
concerned, but the intruders had at last become so numerous and strong
that they had formed an organization among themselves to pass upon
their own claims, and others that might be submitted to them, with
attorneys and ample funds to defend each claim in outside courts
against the decision of the tribe. At the same time the Government
policy was steadily toward the reduction or complete breaking up of
Indian reservations and the allotment of lands to the Indians in
severalty, with a view to their final citizenship, and the opening of
the surplus lands to white settlement. As a part of the same policy the
jurisdiction of the United States courts was gradually being extended
over the Indian country, taking cognizance of many things hitherto
considered by the Indian courts under former treaties with the United
States. Against all this the Cherokee and other civilized tribes
protested, but without avail. To add to the irritation, companies of
armed &ldquo;boomers&rdquo; were organized for the express purpose of
invading and seizing the Cherokee outlet and other unoccupied portions
of the Indian territory&mdash;reserved by treaty for future Indian
settlement&mdash;in defiance of the civil and military power of the
Government.</p>
<p>We come now to what seems the beginning of the end of Indian
autonomy. In 1889 a commission, afterward known as the Cherokee
Commission, was appointed, under act of Congress, to &ldquo;negotiate
with the Cherokee Indians, and with all other Indians owning or
claiming lands lying west of the ninety-sixth degree of longitude in
the Indian territory, for the cession to the United States of all their
title, claim, or interest of every kind or character in and to said
lands.&rdquo; In August of that year the commission made a proposition
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>Chief J. B. Mayes for the cession of all the
Cherokee lands thus described, being that portion known as the Cherokee
outlet or strip. The proposition was declined on the ground that the
Cherokee constitution forbade its consideration.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5066src" href="#xd25e5066" name="xd25e5066src">389</a> Other
tribes were approached for a similar purpose, and the commission was
continued, with changing personnel from year to year, until agreements
for cession and the taking of allotments had been made with nearly all
the wilder tribes in what is now Oklahoma.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Attorney-General had rendered a decision denying
the right of Indian tribes to lease their lands without permission of
the Government. At this time the Cherokee were deriving an annual
income of $150,000 from the lease of grazing privileges upon the strip,
but by a proclamation of President Harrison on February 17, 1890,
ordering the cattlemen to vacate before the end of the year, this
income was cut off and the strip was rendered practically valueless to
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5072src" href="#xd25e5072" name=
"xd25e5072src">390</a> The Cherokee were now forced to come to terms,
and a second proposition for the cession of the Cherokee strip was
finally accepted by the national council on January 4, 1892. &ldquo;It
was known to the Cherokees that for some time would-be settlers on the
lands of the outlet had been encamped in the southern end of Kansas,
and by every influence at their command had been urging the Government
to open the country to settlement and to negotiate with the Cherokees
afterwards, and that a bill for that purpose had been introduced in
Congress.&rdquo; The consideration was nearly $8,600,000, or about
$1.25 per acre, for something over 6,000,000 acres of land. One article
of the agreement stipulates for &ldquo;the reaffirmation to the
Cherokee Nation of the right of local self-government.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e5075src" href="#xd25e5075" name=
"xd25e5075src">391</a> The agreement having been ratified by Congress,
the Cherokee strip was opened by Presidential proclamation on September
16, 1893.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5078src" href="#xd25e5078" name=
"xd25e5078src">392</a></p>
<p>The movement for the abolition of the Indian governments and the
allotment and opening of the Indian country had now gained such force
that by act of Congress approved March 3, 1893, the President was
authorized to appoint a commission of three&mdash;known later as the
Dawes Commission, from its distinguished chairman, Senator Henry L.
Dawes of Massachusetts&mdash;to negotiate with the five civilized
tribes of Indian territory, viz, the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw,
Creek, and Seminole, for &ldquo;the extinguishment of tribal titles to
any lands within that territory, now held by any and all of such
nations and tribes, either by cession of the same or some part thereof
to the United States, or by the allotment and division of the same in
severalty among the Indians of such nations or tribes respectively as
may be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>entitled to the same, or by such other method as
may be agreed upon &hellip; to enable the ultimate creation of a state
or states of the Union, which shall embrace the land within the said
Indian territory.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5085src" href=
"#xd25e5085" name="xd25e5085src">393</a> The commission appointed
arrived in the Indian territory in January, 1894, and at once began
negotiations.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5088src" href="#xd25e5088"
name="xd25e5088src">394</a></p>
<p>At this time the noncitizen element in Indian Territory was
officially reported to number at least 200,000 souls, while those
having rights as citizens of the five civilized tribes, including
full-blood and mixed-blood Indians, adopted whites, and negroes,
numbered but 70,500.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5093src" href=
"#xd25e5093" name="xd25e5093src">395</a> Not all of the noncitizens
were intruders, many being there by permission of the Indian
governments or on official or other legitimate business, but the great
body of them were illegal squatters or unrecognized claimants to Indian
rights, against whose presence the Indians themselves had never ceased
to protest. A test case brought this year in the Cherokee Nation was
decided by the Interior Department against the claimants and in favor
of the Cherokee. Commenting upon threats made in consequence by the
rejected claimants, the agent for the five tribes remarks: &ldquo;It is
not probable that Congress will establish a court to nullify and vacate
a formal decision of the Interior Department.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e5096src" href="#xd25e5096" name="xd25e5096src">396</a> A year
later he says of these intruders that &ldquo;so long as they have a
foothold&mdash;a residence, legal or not&mdash;in the Indian country
they will be disturbers of peace and promoters of discord, and while
they cry aloud, and spare not, for allotment and statehood, they are
but stumbling blocks and obstacles to that mutual good will and
fraternal feeling which must be cultivated and secured before allotment
is practicable and statehood desirable.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5099src" href="#xd25e5099" name="xd25e5099src">397</a> The
removal of the intruders was still delayed, and in 1896 the decision of
citizenship claims was taken from the Indian government and relegated
to the Dawes Commission.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5102src" href=
"#xd25e5102" name="xd25e5102src">398</a></p>
<p>In 1895 the commission was increased to five members, with enlarged
powers. In the meantime a survey of Indian Territory had been ordered
and begun. In September the agent wrote: &ldquo;The Indians now know
that a survey of their lands is being made, and whether with or without
their consent, the survey is going on. The meaning of such survey is
too plain to be disregarded, and it is justly considered as the initial
step, solemn and authoritative, toward the overthrow of their present
communal holdings. At this writing surveying corps are at work in the
Creek, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations, and therefore each one of these
tribes has an ocular demonstration of the actual intent and ultimate
purpose of the government of the United States.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>The general prosperity and advancement of the Cherokee Nation at
this time may be judged from the report of the secretary of the
Cherokee national board of education to Agent Wisdom. He reports 4,800
children attending two seminaries, male and female, two high schools,
and one hundred primary schools, teachers being paid from $35 to $100
per month for nine months in the year. Fourteen primary schools were
for the use of the negro citizens of the Nation, besides which they had
a fine high school, kept up, like all the others, at the expense of the
Cherokee <span class="corr" id="xd25e5113" title=
"Source: goverment">government</span>. Besides the national schools
there were twelve mission schools helping to do splendid work for
children of both citizens and noncitizens. Children of noncitizens were
not allowed to attend the Cherokee national schools, but had their own
subscription schools. The orphan asylum ranked as a high school, in
which 150 orphans were boarded and educated, with graduates every year.
It was a large brick building of three stories, 80 by 240 feet. The
male seminary, accommodating 200 pupils, and the female seminary,
accommodating 225 pupils, were also large brick structures, three
stories in height and 150 by 240 feet on the ground. Three members, all
Cherokee by blood, constituted a board of education. The secretary adds
that the Cherokee are proud of their schools and educational
institutions, and that no other country under the sun is so blessed
with educational advantages at large.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5116src" href="#xd25e5116" name="xd25e5116src">400</a></p>
<p>At this time the Cherokee Nation numbered something over 25,000
Indian, white, and negro citizens; the total citizen population of the
three races in the five civilized tribes numbered about 70,000, while
the noncitizens had increased to 250,000 and their number was being
rapidly augmented.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5121src" href=
"#xd25e5121" name="xd25e5121src">401</a> Realizing that the swift,
inevitable end must be the destruction of their national governments,
the Cherokee began once more to consider the question of removal from
the United States. The scheme is outlined in a letter written by a
brother of the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation under date of May
31, 1895, from which we quote.</p>
<p>After prefacing that the government of the United States seems
determined to break up the tribal autonomy of the five civilized tribes
and to divide their lands, thus bringing about conditions under which
the Cherokee could not exist, he continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Then for a remedy that will lead us out of it, away
from it, and one that promises our preservation as a distinct race of
people in the enjoyment of customs, social and political, that have
been handed down to us from remote generations of the past. My plan is
for the Cherokees to sell their entire landed possessions to the United
States, divide the proceeds thereof per capita, then such as desire to
do so unite in the formation of an Indian colony, and with their funds
jointly purchase in Mexico <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href=
"#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>or South America a body of land
sufficient for all their purposes, to be forever their joint
home&#8202;&hellip;. I believe also that for such Indians as did not
desire to join the colony and leave the country provision should be
made for them to repurchase their old homes, or such other lands in the
country here as they might desire, and they could remain here and meet
such fate as awaits them. I believe this presents the most feasible and
equitable solution of the questions that we must decide in the near
future, and will prove absolutely just and fair to all classes and
conditions of our citizens. I also believe that the same could be acted
upon by any or all of the five civilized
tribes&#8202;&hellip;.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5131src" href=
"#xd25e5131" name="xd25e5131src">402</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final chapter is nearly written. By successive enactments within
the last ten years the jurisdiction of the Indian courts has been
steadily narrowed and the authority of the Federal courts
proportionately extended; the right to determine Indian citizenship has
been taken from the Indians and vested in a Government commission; the
lands of the five tribes have been surveyed and sectionized by
Government surveyors; and by the sweeping provisions of the Curtis act
of June 28, 1898, &ldquo;for the protection of the people of the Indian
Territory,&rdquo; the entire control of tribal revenues is taken from
the five Indian tribes and vested with a resident supervising
inspector, the tribal courts are abolished, allotments are made
compulsory, and authority is given to incorporate white men&rsquo;s
towns in the Indian tribes.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5136src" href=
"#xd25e5136" name="xd25e5136src">403</a> By this act the five civilized
tribes are reduced to the condition of ordinary reservation tribes
under government agents with white communities planted in their midst.
In the meantime the Dawes commission, continued up to the present, has
by unremitting effort broken down the opposition of the Choctaw and
Chickasaw, who have consented to allotment, while the Creeks and the
Seminole are now wavering.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5139src" href=
"#xd25e5139" name="xd25e5139src">404</a> The Cherokee still hold out,
the Ketoowah secret society (47) especially being strong in its
resistance, and when the end comes it is possible that the protest will
take shape in a wholesale emigration to Mexico. Late in 1897 the agent
for the five tribes reports that &ldquo;there seems a determined
purpose on the part of many fullbloods &hellip; to emigrate to either
Mexico or South America and there purchase new homes for themselves and
families. Such individual action may grow to the proportion of a
colony, and it is understood that liberal grants of land can be secured
from the countries mentioned.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5142src" href=
"#xd25e5142" name="xd25e5142src">405</a> Mexican agents are now (1901)
among the Cherokee advocating the scheme, which may develop to include
a large proportion of the five civilized tribes.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>By the census of 1898, the most recent taken, as reported by Agent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=

persons, as follows: Cherokee by blood (including all degrees of
admixture), 26,500; intermarried whites, 2,300; negro freedmen, 4,000;
Delaware, 871; Shawnee, 790. The total acreage of the Nation was
5,031,351 acres, which, if divided per capita under the provisions of
the Curtis bill, after deducting 60,000 acres reserved for town-site
and other purposes, would give to each Cherokee citizen 144
acres.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5152src" href="#xd25e5152" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">THE EASTERN BAND</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It remains to speak of the eastern band of
Cherokee&mdash;the remnant which still clings to the woods and waters
of the old home country. As has been said, a considerable number had
eluded the troops in the general round-up of 1838 and had fled to the
fastnesses of the high mountains. Here they were joined by others who
had managed to break through the guard at Calhoun and other collecting
stations, until the whole number of fugitives in hiding amounted to a
thousand or more, principally of the mountain Cherokee of North
Carolina, the purest-blooded and most conservative of the Nation. About
one-half the refugee warriors had put themselves under command of a
noted leader named U&prime;ts&#259;l&#259;, &ldquo;Lichen,&rdquo; who
made his headquarters amid the lofty peaks at the head of Oconaluftee,
from which secure hiding place, although reduced to extremity of
suffering from starvation and exposure, they defied every effort to
effect their capture.</p>
<p>The work of running down these fugitives proved to be so difficult
an undertaking and so well-nigh barren of result that when Charley and
his sons made their bold stroke for freedom<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5162src" href="#xd25e5162" name="xd25e5162src">408</a> General
Scott eagerly seized the incident as an opportunity for compromise. To
this end he engaged the services of William H. Thomas, a trader who for
more than twenty years had been closely identified with the mountain
Cherokee and possessed their full confidence, and authorized him to
submit to U&prime;ts&#259;l&#259; a proposition that if the latter
would seize Charley and the others who had been concerned in the attack
upon the soldiers and surrender them for punishment, the pursuit would
be called off and the fugitives allowed to stay unmolested until an
effort could be made to secure permission from the general government
for them to remain.</p>
<p>Thomas accepted the commission, and taking with him one or two
Indians made his way over secret paths to
U&prime;ts&#259;l&#259;&rsquo;s hiding place. He presented
Scott&rsquo;s proposition and represented to the chief that by aiding
in bringing Charley&rsquo;s party to punishment according to the rules
of war he could secure respite for his sorely pressed followers, with
the ultimate hope that they might be allowed to remain in their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>own country, whereas if he rejected the offer
the whole force of the seven thousand troops which had now completed
the work of gathering up and deporting the rest of the tribe would be
set loose upon his own small band until the last refugee had been
either taken or killed.</p>
<p>U&prime;ts&#259;l&#259; turned the proposition in his mind long and
seriously. His heart was bitter, for his wife and little son had
starved to death on the mountain side, but he thought of the thousands
who were already on their long march into exile and then he looked
round upon his little band of followers. If only they might stay, even
though a few must be sacrificed, it was better than that all should
die&mdash;for they had sworn never to leave their country. He consented
and Thomas returned to report to General Scott.</p>
<p>Now occurred a remarkable incident which shows the character of
Thomas and the masterly influence which he already had over the
Indians, although as yet he was hardly more than thirty years old. It
was known that Charley and his party were in hiding in a cave of the
Great Smokies, at the head of Deep creek, but it was not thought likely
that he could be taken without bloodshed and a further delay which
might prejudice the whole undertaking. Thomas determined to go to him
and try to persuade him to come in and surrender. Declining
Scott&rsquo;s offer of an escort, he went alone to the cave, and,
getting between the Indians and their guns as they were sitting around
the fire near the entrance, he walked up to Charley and announced his
message. The old man listened in silence and then said simply, &ldquo;I
will come in. I don&rsquo;t want to be hunted down by my own
people.&rdquo; They came in voluntarily and were shot, as has been
already narrated, one only, a mere boy, being spared on account of his
youth. This boy, now an old man, is still living,
Wasit&ucirc;&prime;na, better known to the whites as
Washington.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5176src" href="#xd25e5176" name=
"xd25e5176src">409</a></p>
<p>A respite having thus been obtained for the fugitives, Thomas next
went to Washington to endeavor to make some arrangement for their
permanent settlement. Under the treaty of New Echota, in 1835, the
Cherokee were entitled, besides the lump sum of five million dollars
for the lands ceded, to an additional compensation for the improvements
which they were forced to abandon and for spoliations by white
citizens, together with a per capita allowance to cover the cost of
removal and subsistence for one year in the new country. The twelfth
article had also provided that such Indians as chose to remain in the
East and become citizens there might do so under certain conditions,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>each head of a family thus remaining to be
confirmed in a preemption right to 160 acres. In consequence of the
settled purpose of President Jackson to deport every Indian, this
permission was canceled and supplementary articles substituted by which
some additional compensation was allowed in lieu of the promised
preemptions and all individual reservations granted under previous
treaties.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5183src" href="#xd25e5183" name=
"xd25e5183src">410</a> Every Cherokee was thus made a landless alien in
his original country.</p>
<p>The last party of emigrant Cherokee had started for the West in
December, 1838. Nine months afterwards the refugees still scattered
about in the mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee were reported to
number 1,046.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5188src" href="#xd25e5188"
name="xd25e5188src">411</a> By persistent effort at Washington from
1836 to 1842, including one continuous stay of three years at the
capital city, Thomas finally obtained governmental permission for these
to remain, and their share of the moneys due for improvements and
reservations confiscated was placed at his disposal, as their agent and
trustee, for the purpose of buying lands upon which they could be
permanently settled. Under this authority he bought for them, at
various times up to the year 1861, a number of contiguous tracts of
land upon Oconaluftee river and Soco creek, within the present Swain
and Jackson counties of North Carolina, together with several detached
tracts in the more western counties of the same state. The main body,
upon the waters of Oconaluftee, which was chiefly within the limits of
the cession of 1819, came afterward to be known as the Qualla boundary,
or Qualla reservation, taking the name from Thomas&rsquo; principal
trading store and agency headquarters. The detached western tracts were
within the final cession of 1835, but all alike were bought by Thomas
from white owners. As North Carolina refused to recognize Indians as
landowners within the state, and persisted in this refusal until
1866,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5191src" href="#xd25e5191" name=
"xd25e5191src">412</a> Thomas, as their authorized agent under the
Government, held the deeds in his own name. Before it was legally
possible under the state laws to transfer the title to the Indians, his
own affairs had become involved and his health impaired by age and the
hardships of military service so that his mind gave way, thus leaving
the whole question of the Indian title a subject of litigation until
its adjudication by the United States in 1875, supplemented by further
decisions in 1894.</p>
<p>To Colonel William Holland Thomas the East Cherokee of to-day owe
their existence as a people, and for half a century he was as
intimately connected with their history as was John Ross with that of
the main Cherokee Nation. Singularly enough, their connection with
Cherokee affairs extended over nearly the same period, but while Ross
participated in their national matters Thomas gave his effort to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>a neglected band hardly known in the councils of
the tribe. In his many-sided capacity he strikingly resembles another
white man prominent in Cherokee history, General Sam Houston.</p>
<p>Thomas was born in the year 1805 on Raccoon creek, about two miles
from Waynesville in North Carolina. His father, who was related to
President Zachary Taylor, came of a Welsh family which had immigrated
to Virginia at an early period, while on his mother&rsquo;s side he was
descended from a Maryland family of Revolutionary stock. He was an only
and posthumous child, his father having been accidentally drowned a
short time before the boy was born. Being unusually bright for his age,
he was engaged when only twelve years old to tend an Indian trading
store on Soco creek, in the present Jackson county, owned by Felix
Walker, son of the Congressman of the same name who made a national
reputation by &ldquo;talking for Buncombe.&rdquo; The store was on the
south side of the creek, about a mile above the now abandoned Macedonia
mission, within the present reservation, and was a branch of a larger
establishment which Walker himself kept at Waynesville. The trade was
chiefly in skins and ginseng, or &ldquo;sang,&rdquo; the latter for
shipment to China, where it was said to be worth its weight in silver.
This trade was very profitable, as the price to the Indians was but ten
cents per pound in merchandise for the green root, whereas it now
brings seventy-five cents in cash upon the reservation, the supply
steadily diminishing with every year. The contract was for three
years&rsquo; service for a total compensation of one hundred dollars
and expenses, but Walker devoted so much of his attention to law
studies that the Waynesville store was finally closed for debt, and at
the end of his contract term young Thomas was obliged to accept a lot
of second-hand law books in lieu of other payment. How well he made use
of them is evident from his subsequent service in the state senate and
in other official capacities.</p>
<p>Soon after entering upon his duties he attracted the notice of
Yonaguska, or Drowning-bear
(Y&acirc;&prime;na-g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;sk&#301;,
&ldquo;Bear-drowning-him&rdquo;), the acknowledged chief of all the
Cherokee then living on the waters of Tuckasegee and
Oconaluftee&mdash;the old Kituhwa country. On learning that the boy had
neither father nor brother, the old chief formally adopted him as his
son, and as such he was thenceforth recognized in the tribe under the
name of Wil-Usdi&prime;, or &ldquo;Little Will,&rdquo; he being of
small stature even in mature age. From his Indian friends, particularly
a boy of the same age who was his companion in the store, he learned
the language as well as a white man has ever learned it, so that in his
declining years it dwelt in memory more strongly than his mother
tongue. After the invention of the Cherokee alphabet, he learned also
to read and write the language.</p>

</div>
<p>In 1819 the lands on Tuckasegee and its branches were sold by the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>Indians, and Thomas&rsquo;s mother soon after
removed from Waynesville to a farm which she purchased on the west bank
of Oconaluftee, opposite the mouth of Soco, where her son went to live
with her, having now set up in business for himself at Qualla.
Yonaguska and his immediate connection continued to reside on a small
reservation in the same neighborhood, while the rest of the Cherokee
retired to the west of the Nantahala mountains, though still visiting
and trading on Soco. After several shiftings Thomas finally, soon after
the removal in 1838, bought a farm on the northern bank of Tuckasegee,
just above the present town of Whittier in Swain county, and built
there a homestead which he called Stekoa, after an Indian town
destroyed by Rutherford which had occupied the same site. At the time
of the removal he was the proprietor of five trading stores in or
adjoining the Cherokee country, viz, at Qualla town, near the mouth of
Soco creek; on Scott&rsquo;s creek, near Webster; on Cheowa, near the
present Robbinsville; at the junction of Valley river and Hiwassee, now
Murphy; and at the Cherokee agency at Calhoun (now Charleston),
Tennessee. Besides carrying on a successful trading business he was
also studying law and taking an active interest in local politics.</p>
<p>In his capacity as agent for the eastern Cherokee he laid off the
lands purchased for them into five districts or &ldquo;towns,&rdquo;
which he named Bird town, Paint town, Wolf town, Yellow hill, and Big
cove, the names which they still retain, the first three being those of
Cherokee clans.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5220src" href="#xd25e5220"
name="xd25e5220src">413</a> He also drew up for them a simple form of
government, the execution of which was in his own and Yonaguska&rsquo;s
hands until the death of the latter, after which the band knew no other
chief than Thomas until his retirement from active life. In 1848 he was
elected to the state senate and continued to serve in that capacity
until the outbreak of the civil war. As state senator he inaugurated a
system of road improvements for western North Carolina and was also the
father of the Western North Carolina Railroad (now a part of the
Southern system), originally projected to develop the copper mines of
Ducktown, Tennessee.</p>
<p>With his colleagues in the state senate he voted for secession in
1861, and at once resigned to recruit troops for the Confederacy, to
which, until the close of the war, he gave his whole time, thought, and
effort. In 1862 he organized the Thomas Legion, consisting of two
regiments of infantry, a battalion of cavalry, a company of engineers,
and a field battery, he himself commanding as colonel, although then
nearly sixty years of age. Four companies were made up principally of
his own Cherokee. The Thomas Legion operated chiefly as a frontier
guard <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>for the Confederacy along the mountain region
southward from Cumberland gap.</p>
<p>After the close of the conflict he returned to his home at Stekoa
and again took charge, unofficially, of the affairs of the Cherokee,
whom he attended during the smallpox epidemic of 1866 and assisted
through the unsettled conditions of the reconstruction period. His own
resources had been swept away by the war, and all his hopes had gone
down with the lost cause. This, added to the effects of three years of
hardship and anxiety in the field when already almost past the age
limit, soon after brought about a physical and mental collapse, from
which he never afterward rallied except at intervals, when for a short
time the old spirit would flash out in all its brightness. He died in
1893 at the advanced age of nearly ninety, retaining to the last the
courteous manner of a gentleman by nature and training, with an exact
memory and the clear-cut statement of a lawyer and man of affairs. To
his work in the state senate the people of western North Carolina owe
more than to that of any other man, while among the older Cherokee the
name of Wil-Usdi&prime; is still revered as that of a father and a
great chief.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5229src" href="#xd25e5229"
name="xd25e5229src">414</a></p>
<p>Yonaguska, properly
Y&acirc;&prime;n&ucirc;-g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;sk&#301;, the adopted
father of Thomas, is the most prominent chief in the history of the
East Cherokee, although, singularly enough, his name does not occur in
connection with any of the early wars or treaties. This is due partly
to the fact that he was a peace chief and counselor rather than a war
leader, and in part to the fact that the isolated position of the
mountain Cherokee kept them aloof in a great measure from the tribal
councils of those living to the west and south. In person he was
strikingly handsome, being six feet three inches in height and strongly
built, with a faint tinge of red, due to a slight strain of white blood
on his father&rsquo;s side, relieving the brown of his cheek. In power
of oratory he is said to have surpassed any other chief of his day.
When the Cherokee lands on Tuckasegee were sold by the treaty of 1819,
Yonaguska continued to reside on a reservation of 640 acres in a bend
of the river a short distance above the present Bryson City, on the
site of the ancient Kituhwa. He afterward moved over to Oconaluftee,
and finally, after the Removal, gathered his people about him and
settled with them on Soco creek on lands purchased for them by Thomas.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>He was a prophet and reformer as well as a chief. When about sixty
years of age he had a severe sickness, terminating in a trance, during
which his people mourned him as dead. At the end of twenty-four hours,
however, he awoke to consciousness and announced that he had been to
the spirit world, where he had talked with friends who had gone before,
and with God, who had sent him back with a message to the Indians,
promising to call him again at a later time. From that day until his
death his words were listened to as those of one inspired. He had been
somewhat addicted to liquor, but now, on the recommendation of Thomas,
not only quit drinking himself, but organized his tribe into a
temperance society. To accomplish this he called his people together in
council, and, after clearly pointing out to them the serious effect of
intemperance, in an eloquent speech that moved some of his audience to
tears, he declared that God had permitted him to return to earth
especially that he might thus warn his people and banish whisky from
among them. He then had Thomas write out a pledge, which was signed
first by the chief and then by each one of the council, and from that
time until after his death whisky was unknown among the East
Cherokee.</p>
<p>Although frequent pressure was brought to bear to induce him and his
people to remove to the West, he firmly resisted every persuasion,
declaring that the Indians were safer from aggression among their rocks
and mountains than they could ever be in a land which the white man
could find profitable, and that the Cherokee could be happy only in the
country where nature had planted him. While counseling peace and
friendship with the white man, he held always to his Indian faith and
was extremely suspicious of missionaries. On one occasion, after the
first Bible translation into the Cherokee language and alphabet, some
one brought a copy of Matthew from New Echota, but Yonaguska would not
allow it to be read to his people until it had first been read to
himself. After listening to one or two chapters the old chief dryly
remarked: &ldquo;Well, it seems to be a good book&mdash;strange that
the white people are not better, after having had it so
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He died, aged about eighty, in April, 1839, within a year after the
Removal. Shortly before the end he had himself carried into the
townhouse on Soco, of which he had supervised the building, where,
extended on a couch, he made a last talk to his people, commending
Thomas to them as their chief and again warning them earnestly against
ever leaving their own country. Then wrapping his blanket around him,
he quietly lay back and died. He was buried beside Soco, about a mile
below the old Macedonia mission, with a rude mound of stones to mark
the spot. He left two wives and considerable property, including an old
negro slave named Cudjo, who was devotedly attached to him. One of his
daughters, Kat&acirc;&prime;lsta, still survives, <span class=

<p>Yonaguska had succeeded in authority to Yane&prime;gwa,
&ldquo;Big-bear,&rdquo; who appears to have been of considerable local
prominence in his time, but whose name, even with the oldest of the
band, is now but a memory. He was among the signers of the treaties of
1798 and 1805, and by the treaty of 1819 was confirmed in a reservation
of 640 acres as one of those living within the ceded territory who were
&ldquo;believed to be persons of industry and capable of managing their
property with discretion,&rdquo; and who had made considerable
improvements on the tracts reserved. This reservation, still known as
the Big-bear farm, was on the western bank of Oconaluftee, a few miles
above its mouth, and appears to have been the same afterward occupied
by Yonaguska.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5248src" href="#xd25e5248"

<p>Another of the old notables among the East Cherokee was
Tsunu&prime;l&#259;h&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;sk&#301;, corrupted by the
whites to Junaluska, a great warrior, from whom the ridge west of
Waynesville takes its name. In early life he was known as
G&ucirc;l&prime;&#699;k&#259;la&prime;sk&#301;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5253src" href="#xd25e5253" name="xd25e5253src">417</a> On the
outbreak of the Creek war in 1813 he raised a party of warriors to go
down, as he boasted, &ldquo;to exterminate the Creeks.&rdquo; Not
meeting with complete success, he announced the result, according to
the Cherokee custom, at the next dance after his return in a single
word, <i>detsinu&prime;l&#259;h&ucirc;&ntilde;g&ucirc;&prime;</i>,
&ldquo;I tried, but could not,&rdquo; given out as a cue to the song
leader, who at once took it as the burden of his song. Thenceforth the
disappointed warrior was known as
Tsunu&prime;l&#259;h&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;sk&#301;, &ldquo;One who
tries, but fails.&rdquo; He distinguished himself at the Horseshoe
bend, where the action of the Cherokee decided the battle in favor of
Jackson&rsquo;s army, and was often heard to say after the removal:
&ldquo;If I had known that Jackson would drive us from our homes, I
would have killed him that day at the Horseshoe.&rdquo; He accompanied
the exiles of 1838, but afterward returned to his old home; he was
allowed to remain, and in recognition of his services the state
legislature, by special act, in 1847 conferred upon him the right of
citizenship and granted to him a tract of land in fee simple, but
without power of alienation.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5259src" href=
"#xd25e5259" name="xd25e5259src">418</a> This reservation was in the
Cheowa Indian settlement, near the present Robbinsville, in Graham
county, where he died about the year 1858. His grave is still to be
seen just outside of Robbinsville. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165"

<p>As illustrative of his shrewdness it is told that he once tracked a
little Indian girl to Charleston, South Carolina, where she had been
carried by kidnappers and sold as a slave, and regained her freedom by
proving, from expert microscopic examination, that her hair had none of
the negro characteristics.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5266src" href=

<p>Christianity was introduced among the Kituhwa Cherokee shortly
before the Removal through Worcester and Boudinot&rsquo;s translation
of Matthew, first published at New Echota in 1829. In the absence of
missionaries the book was read by the Indians from house to house.
After the Removal a Methodist minister, Reverend Ulrich Keener, began
to make visits for preaching at irregular intervals, and was followed
several years later by Baptist workers.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>In the fall of 1839 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs reported that
the East Cherokee had recently expressed a desire to join their
brethren in the West, but had been deterred from so doing by the
unsettled condition of affairs in the Territory. He states that
&ldquo;they have a right to remain or to go,&rdquo; but that as the
interests of others are involved in their decision they should decide
without delay.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5276src" href="#xd25e5276"

<p>In 1840 about one hundred Catawba, nearly all that were left of the
tribe, being dissatisfied with their condition in South Carolina, moved
up in a body and took up their residence with the Cherokee. Latent
tribal jealousies broke out, however, and at their own request
negotiations were begun in 1848, through Thomas and others, for their
removal to Indian Territory. The effort being without result, they soon
after began to drift back to their own homes, until, in 1852, there
were only about a dozen remaining among the Cherokee. In 1890 only one
was left, an old woman, the widow of a Cherokee husband. She and her
daughter, both of whom spoke the language, were expert potters
according to the Catawba method, which differs markedly from that of
the Cherokee. There are now two Catawba women, both married to Cherokee
husbands, living with the tribe, and practicing their native
potter&rsquo;s art. While residing among the Cherokee, the Catawba
acquired a reputation as doctors and leaders of the dance.<a class=

<p>On August 6, 1846, a treaty was concluded at Washington with the
representatives of the Cherokee Nation west by which the rights of the
East Cherokee to a participation in the benefits of the New Echota
treaty of 1835 were distinctly recognized, and provision was made for a
final adjustment of all unpaid and pending claims due under that
treaty. The right claimed by the East Cherokee to participate in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>benefits of the New Echota treaty, although not
denied by the government, had been held to be conditional upon their
removal to the West.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5288src" href=

<p>In the spring of 1848 the author, Lanman, visited the East Cherokee
and has left an interesting account of their condition at the time,
together with a description of their ballplays, dances, and customs
generally, having been the guest of Colonel Thomas, of whom he speaks
as the guide, counselor, and friend of the Indians, as well as their
business agent and chief, so that the connection was like that existing
between a father and his children. He puts the number of Indians at
about 800 Cherokee and 100 Catawba on the &ldquo;Qualla town&rdquo;
reservation&mdash;the name being in use thus early&mdash;with 200 more
Indians residing in the more westerly portion of the state. Of their
general condition he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">About three-fourths of the entire population can read
in their own language, and, though the majority of them understand
English, a very few can speak the language. They practice, to a
considerable extent, the science of agriculture, and have acquired such
a knowledge of the mechanic arts as answers them for all ordinary
purposes, for they manufacture their own clothing, their own ploughs,
and other farming utensils, their own axes, and even their own guns.
Their women are no longer treated as slaves, but as equals; the men
labor in the fields and their wives are devoted entirely to household
employments. They keep the same domestic animals that are kept by their
white neighbors, and cultivate all the common grains of the country.
They are probably as temperate as any other class of people on the face
of the earth, honest in their business intercourse, moral in their
thoughts, words, and deeds, and distinguished for their faithfulness in
performing the duties of religion. They are chiefly Methodists and
Baptists, and have regularly ordained ministers, who preach to them on
every Sabbath, and they have also abandoned many of their mere
senseless superstitions. They have their own court and try their
criminals by a regular jury. Their judges and lawyers are chosen from
among themselves. They keep in order the public roads leading through
their settlement. By a law of the state they have a right to vote, but
seldom exercise that right, as they do not like the idea of being
identified with any of the political parties. Excepting on festive
days, they dress after the manner of the white man, but far more
picturesquely. They live in small log houses of their own construction,
and have everything they need or desire in the way of food. They are,
in fact, the happiest community that I have yet met with in this
southern country.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5296src" href="#xd25e5296"
name="xd25e5296src">424</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the other notables Lanman speaks thus of
Sal&acirc;&prime;l&#301;, &ldquo;Squirrel,&rdquo; a born mechanic of
the band, who died only a few years since:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">He is quite a young man and has a remarkably
thoughtful face. He is the blacksmith of his nation, and with some
assistance supplies the whole of Qualla town with all their axes and
plows; but what is more, he has manufactured a number of very superior
rifles and pistols, including stock, barrel, and lock, and he is also
the builder of grist mills, which grind all the corn which his people
eat. A specimen of his workmanship in the way of a rifle may be seen at
the Patent Office in Washington, where it was deposited by Mr. Thomas;
and I believe Salola is the first Indian who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>ever
manufactured an entire gun. But when it is remembered that he never
received a particle of education in any of the mechanic arts but is
entirely self-taught, his attainments must be considered truly
remarkable.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5306src" href="#xd25e5306" name=
"xd25e5306src">425</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On July 29, 1848, Congress approved an act for taking a census of
all those Cherokee who had remained in North Carolina after the
Removal, and who still resided east of the Mississippi, in order that
their share of the &ldquo;removal and subsistence fund&rdquo; under the
New Echota treaty might be set aside for them. A sum equivalent to
$53.33&#8531; was at the same time appropriated for each one, or his
representative, to be available for defraying the expenses of his
removal to the Cherokee Nation west and subsistence there for one year
whenever he should elect so to remove. Any surplus over such expense
was to be paid to him in cash after his arrival in the west. The whole
amount thus expended was to be reimbursed to the Government from the
general fund to the credit of the Cherokee Nation under the terms of
the treaty of New Echota. In the meantime it was ordered that to each
individual thus entitled should be paid the accrued interest on this
per capita sum from the date of the ratification of the New Echota
treaty (May 23, 1836), payment of interest at the same rate to continue
annually thereafter.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5311src" href=
"#xd25e5311" name="xd25e5311src">426</a> In accordance with this act a
census of the Cherokee then residing in North Carolina, Tennessee, and
Georgia, was completed in the fall of 1848 by J. C. Mullay, making the
whole number 2,133. On the basis of this enrollment several payments
were made to them by special agents within the next ten years, one
being a per-capita payment by Alfred Chapman in 1851&ndash;52 of unpaid
claims arising under the treaty of New Echota and amounting in the
aggregate to $197,534.50, the others being payments of the annual
interest upon the &ldquo;removal and subsistence fund&rdquo; set apart
to their credit in 1848. In the accomplishment of these payments two
other enrollments were made by D. W. Siler in 1851 and by Chapman in
1852, the last being simply a corrected revision of the Siler roll, and
neither varying greatly from the Mullay roll.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5320src" href="#xd25e5320" name="xd25e5320src">427</a></p>
<p>Upon the appointment of Chapman to make the per capita payment above
mentioned, the Cherokee Nation west had filed a protest against the
payment, upon the double ground that the East Cherokee had forfeited
their right to participation, and furthermore that their census was
believed to be enormously exaggerated. As a matter of fact the number
first reported by Mullay was only 1,517, to which so many <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>were
subsequently added as to increase the number by more than 600.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e5327src" href="#xd25e5327" name=
"xd25e5327src">428</a> A census taken by their agent, Colonel Thomas,
in 1841, gave the number of East Cherokee (possibly only those in North
Carolina intended) as 1,220,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5330src" href=
"#xd25e5330" name="xd25e5330src">429</a> while a year later the whole
number residing in North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia was
officially estimated at from 1,000 to 1,200.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5333src" href="#xd25e5333" name="xd25e5333src">430</a> It is not
the only time a per capita payment has resulted in a sudden increase of
the census population.</p>
<p>In 1852 (Capt.) James W. Terrell was engaged by Thomas, then in the
state senate, to take charge of his store at Qualla, and remained
associated with him and in close contact with the Indians from then
until after the close of the war, assisting, as special United States
agent, in the disbursement of the interest payments, and afterward as a
Confederate officer in the organization of the Indian companies,
holding a commission as captain of Company A, Sixty-ninth North
Carolina Confederate infantry. Being of an investigating bent, Captain
Terrell was led to give attention to the customs and mythology of the
Cherokee, and to accumulate a fund of information on the subject seldom
possessed by a white man. He still resides at Webster, a few miles from
the reservation, and is now seventy-one years of age.</p>
<p>In 1855 Congress directed the per capita payment to the East
Cherokee of the removal fund established for them in 1848, provided
that North Carolina should first give assurance that they would be
allowed to remain permanently in that state. This assurance, however,
was not given until 1866, and the money was therefore not distributed,
but remained in the treasury until 1875, when it was made applicable to
the purchase of lands and the quieting of titles for the benefit of the
Indians.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5340src" href="#xd25e5340" name=
"xd25e5340src">431</a></p>
<p>From 1855 until after the civil war we find no official notice of
the East Cherokee, and our information must be obtained from other
sources. It was, however, a most momentous period in their history. At
the outbreak of the war Thomas was serving his seventh consecutive term
in the state senate. Being an ardent Confederate sympathizer, he was
elected a delegate to the convention which passed the secession
ordinance, and immediately after voting in favor of that measure
resigned from the senate in order to work for the southern cause. As he
was already well advanced in years it is doubtful if his effort would
have gone beyond the raising of funds and other supplies but for the
fact that at this juncture an effort was made by the Confederate
General Kirby Smith to enlist the East Cherokee for active service.</p>
<p>The agent sent for this purpose was Washington Morgan, known to the
Indians as &Acirc;&prime;ganst&acirc;&prime;ta, son of that Colonel
Gideon Morgan who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169"
name="pb169">169</a>]</span>had commanded the Cherokee at the Horseshoe
bend. By virtue of his Indian blood and historic ancestry he was deemed
the most fitting emissary for the purpose. Early in 1862 he arrived
among the Cherokee, and by appealing to old-time memories so aroused
the war spirit among them that a large number declared themselves ready
to follow wherever he led. Conceiving the question at issue in the war
to be one that did not concern the Indians, Thomas had discouraged
their participation in it and advised them to remain at home in quiet
neutrality. Now, however, knowing Morgan&rsquo;s reputation for
reckless daring, he became alarmed at the possible result to them of
such leadership. Forced either to see them go from his own protection
or to lead them himself, he chose the latter alternative and proposed
to them to enlist in the Confederate legion which he was about to
organize. His object, as he himself has stated, was to keep them out of
danger so far as possible by utilizing them as scouts and home guards
through the mountains, away from the path of the large armies. Nothing
of this was said to the Indians, who might not have been satisfied with
such an arrangement. Morgan went back alone and the Cherokee enrolled
under the command of their white chief.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5350src" href="#xd25e5350" name="xd25e5350src">432</a></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Thomas Legion,&rdquo; recruited in 1862 by William H.
Thomas for the Confederate service and commanded by him as colonel,
consisted originally of one infantry regiment of ten companies
(Sixty-ninth North Carolina Infantry), one infantry battalion of six
companies, one cavalry battalion of eight companies (First North
Carolina Cavalry Battalion), one field battery (Light Battery) of 103
officers and men, and one company of engineers; in all about 2,800 men.
The infantry battalion was recruited toward the close of the war to a
full regiment of ten companies. Companies A and B of the Sixty-ninth
regiment and two other companies of the infantry regiment recruited
later were composed almost entirely of East Cherokee Indians, most of
the commissioned officers being white men. The whole number of Cherokee
thus enlisted was nearly four hundred, or about every able-bodied man
in the tribe.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5355src" href="#xd25e5355"
name="xd25e5355src">433</a></p>
<p>In accordance with Thomas&rsquo;s plan the Indians were employed
chiefly as scouts and home guards in the mountain region along the
Tennessee-Carolina border, where, according to the testimony of Colonel
Stringfield, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>&ldquo;they did good work and service for the
South.&rdquo; The most important engagement in which they were
concerned occurred at Baptist gap, Tennessee, September 15, 1862, where
Lieutenant Astu&prime;gat&acirc;&prime;ga, &ldquo;a splendid specimen
of Indian manhood,&rdquo; was killed in a charge. The Indians were
furious at his death, and before they could be restrained they scalped
one or two of the Federal dead. For this action ample apologies were
afterward given by their superior officers. The war, in fact, brought
out all the latent Indian in their nature. Before starting to the front
every man consulted an oracle stone to learn whether or not he might
hope to return in safety. The start was celebrated with a grand
old-time war dance at the townhouse on Soco, and the same dance was
repeated at frequent intervals thereafter, the Indians being
&ldquo;painted and feathered in good old style,&rdquo; Thomas himself
frequently assisting as master of ceremonies. The ballplay, too, was
not forgotten, and on one occasion a detachment of Cherokee, left to
guard a bridge, became so engrossed in the excitement of the game as to
narrowly escape capture by a sudden dash of the Federals. Owing to
Thomas&rsquo;s care for their welfare, they suffered but slightly in
actual battle, although a number died of hardship and disease. When the
Confederates evacuated eastern Tennessee, in the winter of
1863&ndash;64, some of the white troops of the legion, with one or two
of the Cherokee companies, were shifted to western Virginia, and by
assignment to other regiments a few of the Cherokee were present at the
final siege and surrender of Richmond. The main body of the Indians,
with the rest of the Thomas Legion, crossed over into North Carolina
and did service protecting the western border until the close of the
war, when they surrendered on parole at Waynesville, North Carolina, in
May, 1865, all those of the command being allowed to keep their guns.
It is claimed by their officers that they were the last of the
Confederate forces to surrender. About fifty of the Cherokee veterans
still survive, nearly half of whom, under conduct of Colonel
Stringfield, attended the Confederate reunion at Louisville, Kentucky,
in 1900, where they attracted much attention.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5362src" href="#xd25e5362" name="xd25e5362src">434</a></p>
<p>In 1863, by resolution of February 12, the Confederate House of
Representatives called for information as to the number and condition
of the East Cherokee, and their pending relations with the Federal
government at the beginning of the war, with a view to continuing these
relations under Confederate auspices. In response to this inquiry a
report was submitted by the Confederate commissioner of Indian affairs,
S. S. Scott, based on information furnished by Colonel Thomas and
Captain James W. Terrell, their former disbursing agent, showing that
interest upon the &ldquo;removal and subsistence fund&rdquo;
established <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>in 1848 had been paid annually up to and
including the year 1859, at the rate of $3.20 per capita, or an
aggregate, exclusive of disbursing agent&rsquo;s commission, of
$4,838.40 annually, based upon the original Mullay enumeration of
1,517.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of this report it was enacted by the Confederate
congress that the sum of $19,352.36 be paid the East Cherokee to cover
the interest period of four years from May 23, 1860, to May 23, 1864.
In this connection the Confederate commissioner suggested that the
payment be made in provisions, of which the Indians were then greatly
in need, and which, if the payment were made in cash, they would be
unable to purchase, on account of the general scarcity. He adds that,
according to his information, almost every Cherokee capable of bearing
arms was then in the Confederate service. The roll furnished by Captain
Terrell is the original Mullay roll corrected to May, 1860, no
reference being made to the later Mullay enumeration (2,133), already
alluded to. There is no record to show that the payment thus authorized
was made, and as the Confederate government was then in hard straits it
is probable that nothing further was done in the matter.</p>
<p>In submitting his statement of previous payments, Colonel Thomas,
their former agent, adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">As the North Carolina Cherokees have, like their
brethren west, taken up arms against the Lincoln government, it is not
probable that any further advances of interest will be made by that
government to any portion of the Cherokee tribe. I also enclose a copy
of the act of July 29, 1848, so far as relates to the North Carolina
Cherokees, and a printed explanation of their rights, prepared by me in
1851, and submitted to the attorney-general, and his opinion thereon,
which may not be altogether uninteresting to those who feel an interest
in knowing something of the history of the Cherokee tribe of Indians,
whose destiny is so closely identified with that of the Southern
Confederacy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5379src" href="#xd25e5379"
name="xd25e5379src">435</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a skirmish near Bryson City (then Charleston), Swain county,
North Carolina, about a year after enlistment, a small party of
Cherokee&mdash;perhaps a dozen in number&mdash;was captured by a
detachment of Union troops and carried to Knoxville, where, having
become dissatisfied with their experience in the Confederate service,
they were easily persuaded to go over to the Union side. Through the
influence of their principal man, Dig&#259;ne&prime;sk&#301;, several
others were induced to desert to the Union army, making about thirty in
all. As a part of the Third North Carolina Mounted Volunteer Infantry,
they served with the Union forces in the same region until the close of
the war, when they returned to their homes to find their tribesmen so
bitterly incensed against them that for some time their lives were in
danger. Eight of these are still alive in 1900.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5384src" href="#xd25e5384" name="xd25e5384src">436</a></p>
<p>One of these Union Cherokee had brought back with him the smallpox
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>from an infected camp near Knoxville. Shortly
after his return he became sick and soon died. As the characteristic
pustules had not appeared, the disease seeming to work inwardly, the
nature of his sickness was not at first suspected&mdash;smallpox having
been an unknown disease among the Cherokee for nearly a
century&mdash;and his funeral was largely attended. A week later a
number of those who had been present became sick, and the disease was
recognized by Colonel Thomas as smallpox in all its virulence. It
spread throughout the tribe, this being in the early spring of 1866,
and in spite of all the efforts of Thomas, who brought a doctor from
Tennessee to wait upon them, more than one hundred of the small
community died in consequence. The fatal result was largely due to the
ignorance of the Indians, who, finding their own remedies of no avail,
used the heroic aboriginal treatment of the plunge bath in the river
and the cold-water douche, which resulted in death in almost every
case. Thus did the war bring its harvest of death, misery, and civil
feud to the East Cherokee.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5391src" href=
"#xd25e5391" name="xd25e5391src">437</a></p>
<p>Shortly after this event Colonel Thomas was compelled by physical
and mental infirmity to retire from further active participation in the
affairs of the East Cherokee, after more than half a century spent in
intimate connection with them, during the greater portion of which time
he had been their most trusted friend and adviser. Their affairs at
once became the prey of confusion and factional strife, which continued
until the United States stepped in as arbiter.</p>
<p>In 1868 Congress ordered another census of the East Cherokee, to
serve as a guide in future payments, the roll to include only those
persons whose names had appeared upon the Mullay roll of 1848 and their
legal heirs and representatives. The work was completed in the
following year by S. H. Sweatland, and a payment of interest then due
under former enactment was made by him on this basis.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e5398src" href="#xd25e5398" name="xd25e5398src">438</a>
&ldquo;In accordance with their earnestly expressed desire to be
brought under the immediate charge of the government as its
wards,&rdquo; the Congress which ordered this last census directed that
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs should assume the same charge over
the East Cherokee as over other tribes, but as no extra funds were made
available for the purpose the matter was held in abeyance.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e5401src" href="#xd25e5401" name=
"xd25e5401src">439</a> An unratified treaty made this year with the
Cherokee Nation west contained a stipulation that any Cherokee east of
the Mississippi who should remove to the Cherokee nation within three
years should be entitled to full citizenship and privileges therein,
but after that date could be admitted only by act of the Cherokee
national council.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5404src" href="#xd25e5404"
name="xd25e5404src">440</a></p>
<p>After the retirement of Thomas, in the absence of any active
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=

central authority. On December 9, 1868, a general council of the East
Cherokee assembled at Cheowa, in Graham county, North Carolina, took
preliminary steps toward the adoption of a regular form of tribal
government under a constitution. N. J. Smith, afterward principal
chief, was clerk of the council. The new government was formally
inaugurated on December 1, 1870. It provided for a first and a second
chief to serve for a term of two years, minor officers to serve one
year, and an annual council representing each Cherokee settlement
within the state of North Carolina. K&acirc;&prime;lah&ucirc;&prime;,
&ldquo;All-bones,&rdquo; commonly known to the whites as
Flying-squirrel or Sawnook (Saw&#259;nu&prime;g&#301;), was elected
chief. A new constitution was adopted five years later, by which the
chief&rsquo;s term of office was fixed at four years.<a class="noteref"

<p>The status of the lands held by the Indians had now become a matter
of serious concern, As has been stated, the deeds had been made out by
Thomas in his own name, as the state laws at that time forbade Indian
ownership of real estate. In consequence of his losses during the war
and his subsequent disability, the Thomas properties, of which the
Cherokee lands were technically a part, had become involved, so that
the entire estate had passed into the hands of creditors, the most
important of whom, William Johnston, had obtained sheriff&rsquo;s deeds
in 1869 for all of these Indian lands under three several judgments
against Thomas, aggregating $33,887.11. To adjust the matter so as to
secure title and possession to the Indians, Congress in 1870 authorized
suit to be brought in their name for the recovery of their interest.
This suit was begun in May, 1873, in the United States circuit court
for western North Carolina. A year later the matters in dispute were
submitted by agreement to a board of arbitrators, whose award was
confirmed by the court in November, 1874.</p>
<p>The award finds that Thomas had purchased with Indian funds a tract
estimated to contain 50,000 acres on Oconaluftee river and Soco creek,
and known as the Qualla boundary, together with a number of individual
tracts outside the boundary; that the Indians were still indebted to
Thomas toward the purchase of the Qualla boundary lands for the sum of
$18,250, from which should be deducted $6,500 paid by them to Johnston
to release titles, with interest to date of award, making an aggregate
of $8,486, together with a further sum of $2,478, which had been
intrusted to Terrell, the business clerk and assistant of Thomas, and
by him turned over to Thomas, as creditor of the Indians, under power
of attorney, this latter sum, with interest to date of award,
aggregating $2,697.89; thus leaving a balance due from the Indians to
Thomas or his legal creditor, Johnston, of $7,066.11. The award
declares that on account of the questionable manner in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>which the disputed lands had been bought in by
Johnston, he should be allowed to hold them only as security for the
balance due him until paid, and that on the payment of the said balance
of $7,066.11, with interest at 6 per cent from the date of the award,
the Indians should be entitled to a clear conveyance from him of the
legal title to all the lands embraced within the Qualla
boundary.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5421src" href="#xd25e5421" name=
"xd25e5421src">442</a></p>
<p>To enable the Indians to clear off this lien on their lands and for
other purposes, Congress in 1875 directed that as much as remained of
the &ldquo;removal and subsistence fund&rdquo; set apart for their
benefit in 1848 should be used &ldquo;in perfecting the titles to the
lands awarded to them, and to pay the costs, expenses, and liabilities
attending their recent litigations, also to purchase and extinguish the
titles of any white persons to lands within the general boundaries
allotted to them by the court, and for the education, improvement, and
civilization of their people.&rdquo; In accordance with this authority
the unpaid balance and interest due Johnston, amounting to $7,242.76,
was paid him in the same year, and shortly afterward there was
purchased on behalf of the Indians some fifteen thousand acres
additional, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs being constituted
trustee for the Indians. For the better protection of the Indians the
lands were made inalienable except by assent of the council and upon
approval of the President of the United States. The deeds for the
Qualla boundary and the 15,000 acre purchase were executed respectively
on October 9, 1876, and August 14, 1880.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5429src" href="#xd25e5429" name="xd25e5429src">443</a> As the
boundaries of the different purchases were but vaguely defined, a new
survey of the whole Qualla boundary and adjoining tracts was
authorized. The work was intrusted to M. S. Temple, deputy United
States surveyor, who completed it in 1876, his survey maps of the
reservation being accepted as the official standard.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e5432src" href="#xd25e5432" name="xd25e5432src">444</a></p>
<p>The titles and boundaries having been adjusted, the Indian Office
assumed regular supervision of East Cherokee affairs, and in June,
1875, the first agent since the retirement of Thomas was sent out in
the person of W. C. McCarthy. He found the Indians, according to his
report, destitute and discouraged, almost without stock or farming
tools. There were no schools, and very few full-bloods could speak
English, although to their credit nearly all could read and write their
own language, the parents teaching the children. Under his authority a
distribution was made of stock animals, seed wheat, and farming tools,
and several schools were started. In the next year, however,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>the agency was discontinued and the educational
interests of the band turned over to the state school
superintendent.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5439src" href="#xd25e5439"
name="xd25e5439src">445</a></p>
<p>In the meantime K&acirc;&prime;lah&ucirc;&prime; had been succeeded
as chief by Lloyd R. Welch (Da&prime;si&#699;giya&prime;g&#301;), an
educated mixed-blood of Cheowa, who served about five years, dying
shortly after his reelection to a second term (48). He made a good
record by his work in reconciling the various factions which had sprung
up after the withdrawal of the guiding influence of Thomas, and in
defeating the intrigues of fraudulent white claimants and mischief
makers. Shortly before his death the Government, through Special Agent
John A. Sibbald, recognized his authority as principal chief, together
with the constitution which had been adopted by the band under his
auspices in 1875. N. J. Smith (Tsa&prime;l&#259;dih&#301;&prime;), who
had previously served as clerk of the council, was elected to his
unexpired term and continued to serve until the fall of 1890.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e5447src" href="#xd25e5447" name=
"xd25e5447src">446</a></p>
<p>We find no further official notice of the East Cherokee until 1881,
when Commissioner Price reported that they were still without agent or
superintendent, and that so far as the Indian Office was concerned
their affairs were in an anomalous and unsatisfactory condition, while
factional feuds were adding to the difficulties and retarding the
progress of the band. In the spring of that year a visiting delegation
from the Cherokee Nation west had extended to them an urgent invitation
to remove to Indian Territory and the Indian Office had encouraged the
project, with the result that 161 persons of the band removed during
the year to Indian Territory, the expense being borne by the
Government. Others were represented as being desirous to remove, and
the Commissioner recommended an appropriation for the purpose, but as
Congress failed to act the matter was dropped.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5452src" href="#xd25e5452" name="xd25e5452src">447</a></p>
<p>The neglected condition of the East Cherokee having been brought to
the attention of those old-time friends of the Indian, the Quakers,
through an appeal made in their behalf by members of that society
residing in North Carolina, the Western Yearly Meeting, of Indiana,
volunteered to undertake the work of civilization and education. On May
31, 1881, representatives of the Friends entered into a contract with
the Indians, subject to approval by the Government, to establish and
continue among them for ten years an industrial school and other common
schools, to be supported in part from the annual interest of the trust
fund held by the Government to the credit of the East Cherokee and in
part by funds furnished by the Friends themselves. Through the efforts
of Barnabas C. Hobbs, of the Western Yearly Meeting, a yearly contract
to the same effect was entered into with the Commissioner <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>of
Indian Affairs later in the same year, and was renewed by successive
commissioners to cover the period of ten years ending June 30, 1892,
when the contract system was terminated and the Government assumed
direct control. Under the joint arrangement, with some aid at the
outset from the North Carolina Meeting, work was begun in 1881 by
Thomas Brown with several teachers sent out by the Indiana Friends, who
established a small training school at the agency headquarters at
Cherokee, and several day schools in the outlying settlements. He was
succeeded three years later by H. W. Spray, an experienced educator,
who, with a corps of efficient assistants and greatly enlarged
facilities, continued to do good work for the elevation of the Indians
until the close of the contract system eight years later.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e5459src" href="#xd25e5459" name=
"xd25e5459src">448</a> After an interregnum, during which the schools
suffered from frequent changes, he was reappointed as government agent
and superintendent in 1898, a position which he still holds in 1901. To
the work conducted under his auspices the East Cherokee owe much of
what they have to-day of civilization and enlightenment.</p>
<p>From some travelers who visited the reservation about this time we
have a pleasant account of a trip along Soco and a day with Chief Smith
at Yellow Hill. They describe the Indians as being so nearly like the
whites in their manner of living that a stranger could rarely
distinguish an Indian&rsquo;s cabin or little cove farm from that of a
white man. Their principal crop was corn, which they ground for
themselves, and they had also an abundance of apples, peaches, and
plums, and a few small herds of ponies and cattle. Their wants were so
few that they had but little use for money. Their primitive costume had
long been obsolete, and their dress was like that of the whites,
excepting that moccasins took the place of shoes, and they manufactured
their own clothing by the aid of spinning-wheels and looms. Finely cut
pipes and well-made baskets were also produced, and the good influence
of the schools recently established was already manifest in the
children.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5464src" href="#xd25e5464" name=
"xd25e5464src">449</a></p>
<p>In 1882 the agency was reestablished and provision was made for
taking a new census of all Cherokee east of the Mississippi, Joseph G.
Hester being appointed to the work.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5469src"
href="#xd25e5469" name="xd25e5469src">450</a> The census was submitted
as complete in June, 1884, and contained the names of 1,881 persons in
North Carolina, 758 in Georgia, 213 in Tennessee, 71 in Alabama, and 33
scattering, a total of 2,956.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5472src" href=
"#xd25e5472" name="xd25e5472src">451</a> Although this census received
the approval and certificate of the East Cherokee council, a large
portion of the band still refuse to recognize it as authoritative,
claiming that a large number of persons therein enrolled have no
Cherokee blood. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177"
name="pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>The East Cherokee had never ceased to contend for a participation in
the rights and privileges accruing to the western Nation under treaties
with the Government. In 1882 a special agent had been appointed to
investigate their claims, and in the following year, under authority of
Congress, the eastern band of Cherokee brought suit in the Court of
Claims against the United States and the Cherokee Nation west to
determine its rights in the permanent annuity fund and other trust
funds held by the United States for the Cherokee Indians.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e5478src" href="#xd25e5478" name=
"xd25e5478src">452</a> The case was decided adversely to the eastern
band, first by the Court of Claims in 1885,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5481src" href="#xd25e5481" name="xd25e5481src">453</a> and
finally, on appeal, by the Supreme Court on March 1, 1886, that court
holding in its decision that the Cherokee in North Carolina had
dissolved their connection with the Cherokee Nation and ceased to be a
part of it when they refused to accompany the main body at the Removal,
and that if Indians in North Carolina or in any state east of the
Mississippi wished to enjoy the benefits of the common property of the
Cherokee Nation in any form whatever they must be readmitted to
citizenship in the Cherokee Nation and comply with its constitution and
laws. In accordance with this decision the agent in the Indian
territory was instructed to issue no more residence permits to
claimants for Cherokee citizenship, and it was officially announced
that all persons thereafter entering that country without consent of
the Cherokee authorities would be treated as intruders.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e5484src" href="#xd25e5484" name=
"xd25e5484src">454</a> This decision, cutting off the East Cherokee
from all hope of sharing in any of the treaty benefits enjoyed by their
western kinsmen, was a sore disappointment to them all, especially to
Chief Smith, who had worked unceasingly in their behalf from the
institution of the proceedings. In view of the result, Commissioner
Atkins strongly recommended, as the best method of settling them in
permanent homes, secure from white intrusion and from anxiety on
account of their uncertain tenure and legal status in North Carolina,
that negotiations be opened through government channels for their
readmission to citizenship in the Cherokee Nation, to be followed, if
successful, by the sale of their lands in North Carolina and their
removal to Indian Territory.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5487src" href=
"#xd25e5487" name="xd25e5487src">455</a></p>
<p>In order to acquire a more definite legal status, the Cherokee
residing in North Carolina&mdash;being practically all those of the
eastern band having genuine Indian interests&mdash;became a corporate
body under the laws of the state in 1889. The act, ratified on March
11, declares in its first section &ldquo;That the North Carolina or
Eastern Cherokee Indians, resident or domiciled in the counties of
Jackson, Swain, Graham, and Cherokee, be and at the same time are
hereby <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>created and constituted a body politic and
corporate under the name, style, and title of the Eastern Band of
Cherokee Indians, with all the rights, franchises, privileges and
powers incident and belonging to corporations under the laws of the
state of North Carolina.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5495src" href=
"#xd25e5495" name="xd25e5495src">456</a></p>
<p>On August 2, 1893, ex-Chief Smith died at Cherokee, in the
fifty-seventh year of his life, more than twenty of which had been
given to the service of his people. Nimrod Jarrett Smith, known to the
Cherokee as Tsa&prime;l&#259;dih&#301;&prime;, was the son of a half
breed father by an Indian mother, and was born near the present Murphy,
Cherokee county, North Carolina, on January 3, 1837. His earliest
recollections were thus of the miseries that attended the flight of the
refugees to the mountains during the Removal period. His mother spoke
very little English, but his father was a man of considerable
intelligence, having acted as interpreter and translator for Reverend
Evan Jones at the old Valleytown mission. As the boy grew to manhood he
acquired a fair education, which, aided by a commanding presence, made
him a person of influence among his fellows. At twenty-five years of
age he enlisted in the Thomas Legion as first sergeant of Company B,
Sixty-ninth North Carolina (Confederate) Infantry, and served in that
capacity till the close of the war. He was clerk of the council that
drafted the first East Cherokee constitution in 1868, and on the death
of Principal Chief Lloyd Welch in 1880 was elected to fill the
unexpired term, continuing in office by successive reelections until
the close of 1891, a period of about twelve years, the longest term yet
filled by an incumbent. As principal chief he signed the contract under
which the school work was inaugurated in 1881. For several years
thereafter his duties, particularly in connection with the suit against
the western Cherokee, required his presence much of the time at
Washington, while at home his time was almost as constantly occupied in
attending to the wants of a dependent people. Although he was entitled
under the constitution of the band to a salary of five hundred dollars
per year, no part of this salary was ever paid, because of the limited
resources of his people, and only partial reimbursement was made to
him, shortly before his death, for expenses incurred in official visits
to Washington. With frequent opportunities to enrich himself at the
expense of his people, he maintained his honor and died a poor man.</p>
<p>In person Chief Smith was a splendid specimen of physical manhood,
being six feet four inches in height and built in proportion, erect in
figure, with flowing black hair curling down over his shoulders, a deep
musical voice, and a kindly spirit and natural dignity that never
failed to impress the stranger. His widow&mdash;a white woman&mdash;and
several children survive him.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5502src" href=

<p>In 1894 the long-standing litigation between the East Cherokee and a
number of creditors and claimants to Indian lands within and adjoining
the Qualla boundary was finally settled by a compromise by which the
several white tenants and claimants within the boundary agreed to
execute a quitclaim and vacate on payment to them by the Indians of
sums aggregating $24,552, while for another disputed adjoining tract of
33,000 acres the United States agreed to pay, for the Indians, at the
rate of $1.25 per acre. The necessary Government approval having been
obtained, Congress appropriated a sufficient amount for carrying into
effect the agreement, thus at last completing a perfect and
unincumbered title to all the lands claimed by the Indians, with the
exception of a few outlying tracts of comparative
unimportance.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5522src" href="#xd25e5522"
name="xd25e5522src">458</a></p>
<p>In 1895 the Cherokee residing in North Carolina upon the reservation
and in the outlying settlements were officially reported to number
1,479.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5527src" href="#xd25e5527" name=
"xd25e5527src">459</a> A year later an epidemic of grippe spread
through the band, with the result that the census of 1897 shows but
1,312,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5530src" href="#xd25e5530" name=
"xd25e5530src">460</a> among those who died at this time being
Big-witch (Tsk&#301;l-e&prime;gwa), the oldest man of the band, who
distinctly remembered the Creek war, and Wadi&prime;y&#259;h&#301;, the
last old woman who preserved the art of making double-walled baskets.
In the next year the population had recovered to 1,351. The description
of the mode of living then common to most of the Indians will apply
nearly as well to-day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">While they are industrious, these people are not
progressive farmers and have learned nothing of modern methods. The
same crops are raised continuously until the soil will yield no more or
is washed away, when new ground is cleared or broken. The value of
rotation and fertilizing has not yet been discovered or
taught&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>That these people can live at all upon the products of their small
farms is due to the extreme simplicity of their food, dress, and manner
of living. The typical house is of logs, is about fourteen by sixteen
feet, of one room, just high enough for the occupants to stand erect,
with perhaps a small loft for the storage of extras. The roof is of
split shingles or shakes. There is no window, the open door furnishing
what light is required. At one end of the house is the fireplace, with
outside chimney of stones or sticks chinked with clay. The furniture is
simple and cheap. An iron pot, a bake kettle, a coffeepot and mill,
small table, and a few cups, knives, and spoons are all that is needed.
These, with one or two bedsteads, homemade, a few pillows and quilts,
with feather mattresses for winter covering, as well as for the usual
purpose, constitute the principal house possessions. For outdoor work
there is an ax, hoe, and shovel plow. A wagon or cart may be owned, but
is not essential. The outfit is inexpensive and answers every purpose.
The usual food is bean bread, with coffee. In the fall chestnut bread
is also used. Beef is seldom eaten, but pork is highly esteemed, and a
considerable number of hogs are kept, running wild and untended in
summer.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5538src" href="#xd25e5538" name=
"xd25e5538src">461</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the most recent official count, in 1900, the East Cherokee
residing in North Carolina under direct charge of the agent and
included <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>within the act of incorporation number 1,376, of
whom about 1,100 are on the reservation, the rest living farther to the
west, on Nantahala, Cheowa, and Hiwassee rivers. This does not include
mixed-bloods in adjoining states and some hundreds of unrecognized
claimants. Those enumerated own approximately 100,000 acres of land, of
which 83,000 are included within the Qualla reservation and a
contiguous tract in Jackson and Swain counties. They receive no rations
or annuities and are entirely self-supporting, the annual interest on
their trust fund established in 1848, which has dwindled to about
$23,000, being applied to the payment of taxes upon their unoccupied
common lands. From time to time they have made leases of timber,
gold-washing, and grazing privileges, but without any great profit to
themselves. By special appropriation the government supports an
industrial training school at Cherokee, the agency headquarters, in
which 170 pupils are now being boarded, clothed, and educated in the
practical duties of life. This school, which in its workings is a model
of its kind, owes much of its usefulness and high standing to the
efficient management of Prof. H. W. Spray
(W&#301;ls&#301;n&#301;&prime;), already mentioned, who combines the
duties of superintendent and agent for the band. His chief clerk, Mr
James Blythe (Diskwa&prime;&#699;n&#301;,
&ldquo;Chestnut-bread&rdquo;), a Cherokee by blood, at one time filled
the position of agent, being perhaps the only Indian who has ever
served in such capacity.</p>
<p>The exact legal status of the East Cherokee is still a matter of
dispute, they being at once wards of the government, citizens of the
United States, and (in North Carolina) a corporate body under state
laws. They pay real estate taxes and road service, exercise the voting
privilege,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5547src" href="#xd25e5547" name=
"xd25e5547src">462</a> and are amenable to the local courts, but do not
pay poll tax or receive any pauper assistance from the counties;
neither can they make free contracts or alienate their lands (49).
Under their tribal constitution they are governed by a principal and an
assistant chief, elected for a term of four years, with an executive
council appointed by the chief, and sixteen councilors elected by the
various settlements for a term of two years. The annual council is held
in October at Cherokee, on the reservation, the proceedings being in
the Cherokee language and recorded by their clerk in the Cherokee
alphabet, as well as in English. The present chief is Jesse Reid
(Ts&#277;&prime;si-Ska&prime;ts&#301;, &ldquo;Scotch Jesse&rdquo;), an
intelligent mixed-blood, who fills the office with dignity and ability.
As a people they are peaceable and law-abiding, kind and hospitable,
providing for their simple wants by their own industry without asking
or expecting outside assistance. Their fields, orchards, and fish
traps, with some few domestic animals and occasional hunting, supply
them with food, while by the sale of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>ginseng and other
medicinal plants gathered in the mountains, with fruit and honey of
their own raising, they procure what additional supplies they need from
the traders. The majority are fairly comfortable, far above the
condition of most Indian tribes, and but little, if any, behind their
white neighbors. In literary ability they may even be said to surpass
them, as in addition to the result of nearly twenty years of school
work among the younger people, nearly all the men and some of the women
can read and write their own language. All wear civilized costumes,
though an occasional pair of moccasins is seen, while the women find
means to gratify the racial love of color in the wearing of red
bandanna kerchiefs in place of bonnets. The older people still cling to
their ancient rites and sacred traditions, but the dance and the
ballplay wither and the Indian day is nearly spent. <span class=

notes on the Cherokee round-up and Removal are almost entirely from

Cherokee and white, among whom may be named the late Colonel W. H.
Thomas; the late Colonel Z. A. Zile, of Atlanta, of the Georgia
volunteers; the late James Bryson, of Dillsboro, North Carolina, also a
volunteer; James D. Wafford, of the western Cherokee Nation, who
commanded one of the emigrant detachments; and old Indians, both east
and west, who remembered the Removal and had heard the story from their
parents. Charley&rsquo;s story is a matter of common note among the
East Cherokee, and was heard in full detail from Colonel Thomas and
from Wasit&ucirc;na (&ldquo;Washington&rdquo;), Charley&rsquo;s
youngest son, who alone was spared by General Scott on account of his
youth. The incident is also noted, with some slight inaccuracies, in

Author&rsquo;s personal information. In 1891 the author opened two
Uchee graves on the grounds of Cornelius Boudinot, at Tahlequah,
finding with one body a number of French, Spanish, and American silver
coins wrapped in cloth and deposited in two packages on each side of
the head. They are now in the National Museum at

Author&rsquo;s personal information from J. D. Wafford and other old
Cherokee residents and from recent Cherokee delegates. Bancroft agrees
with Bonnell and Thrall that no grant was formally issued, but states
that the Cherokee chief established his people in Texas
&ldquo;confiding in promises made to him, and a conditional agreement
in 1822&rdquo; with the Spanish governor (History of the North Mexican
States and Texas, <span class="sc">II</span>, p. 103, 1889). It is
probable that the paper carried by Bowl was the later Houston treaty.

Charley&rsquo;s story as here given is from the author&rsquo;s personal
information, derived chiefly from conversations with Colonel Thomas and
with Wasit&ucirc;&prime;na and other old Indians. An ornate but
somewhat inaccurate account is given also in Lanman&rsquo;s Letters
from the Alleghany Mountains, written on the ground ten years after the
events described. The leading facts are noted in General Scott&rsquo;s

the author&rsquo;s conversations with Thomas himself, supplemented by
information from his former assistant, Capt. James W. Terrell, and
others who knew him, together with an admirable sketch in the North
Carolina University Magazine for May 1899, by Mrs. A. C. Avery, his
daughter. He is also frequently noticed, in connection with East
Cherokee matters, in the annual reports of the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs; in the North Carolina Confederate Roster; in Lanman&rsquo;s
Letters from the Alleghany Mountains; and in Zeigler and
Grosscup&rsquo;s Heart of the Alleghanies, etc. Some manuscript
contributions to the library of the Georgia Historical Society in

and in Zeigler and Grosscup&rsquo;s Heart of the Alleghanies, 1883. The
trance which, according to Thomas and Lanman, lasted about one day, is
stretched by the last-named authors to fifteen days, with the whole

is believed to be a correct statement of the strength and make-up of
the Thomas Legion. Owing to the imperfection of the records and the
absence of reliable memoranda among the surviving officers, no two
accounts exactly coincide. The roll given in the North Carolina
Confederate Roster, handed in by Captain Terrell, assistant
quartermaster, was compiled early in the war and contains no notice of
the engineer company or of the second infantry regiment; which included
two other Indian companies. The information therein contained is
supplemented from conversations and personal letters of Captain
Terrell, and from letters and newspaper articles by Lieutenant-Colonel
Stringfield of the Sixty-ninth. Another statement is given in Mrs
Avery&rsquo;s sketch of Colonel Thomas in the North Carolina University
Magazine for May, 1899.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<h2 class="main">III&mdash;NOTES TO THE HISTORICAL SKETCH</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">(1) <span class="sc">Tribal synonymy</span> (page 15):
Very few Indian tribes are known to us under the names by which they
call themselves. One reason for this is the fact that the whites have
usually heard of a tribe from its neighbors, speaking other languages,
before coming upon the tribe itself. Many of the popular tribal names
were originally nicknames bestowed by neighboring tribes, frequently
referring to some peculiar custom, and in a large number of cases would
be strongly repudiated by the people designated by them. As a rule each
tribe had a different name in every surrounding Indian language,
besides those given by Spanish, French, Dutch, or English settlers.</p>
<p><i>Y&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;wiy&#259;&prime;</i>&mdash;This word is
compounded from <i>y&ucirc;&ntilde;w&#301;</i> (person) and
<i>y&#259;</i> (real or principal). The assumption of superiority is
much in evidence in Indian tribal names; thus, the Iroquois, Delawares,
and Pawnee call themselves, respectively, O&ntilde;we-ho&ntilde;we,
Leni-lenape&prime;, and Tsariksi-tsa&prime;riks, all of which may be
rendered &ldquo;men of men,&rdquo; &ldquo;men surpassing other
men,&rdquo; or &ldquo;real men.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>K&#301;tu&prime;hwag&#301;</i>&mdash;This word, which can not be
analyzed, is derived from K&#301;tu&prime;hw&#259;, the name of an
ancient Cherokee settlement formerly on Tuckasegee river, just above
the present Bryson City, in Swain county, North Carolina. It is noted
in 1730 as one of the &ldquo;seven mother towns&rdquo; of the tribe.
Its inhabitants were called Ani&prime;-K&#301;tu&prime;hwag&#301;
(people of Kituhwa), and seem to have exercised a controlling influence
over those of all the towns on the waters of Tuckasegee and the upper
part of Little Tennessee, the whole body being frequently classed
together as Ani&prime;-K&#301;tu&prime;hwag&#301;. The dialect of these
towns held a middle place linguistically between those spoken to the
east, on the heads of Savannah, and to the west, on Hiwassee, Cheowah,
and the lower course of Little Tennessee. In various forms the word was
adopted by the Delawares, Shawano, and other northern Algonquian tribes
as a synonym for Cherokee, probably from the fact that the Kituhwa
people guarded the Cherokee northern frontier. In the form Cuttawa it
appears on the French map of Vaugondy in 1755. From a similarity of
spelling, Schoolcraft incorrectly makes it a synonym for Catawba, while
Brinton incorrectly asserts that it is an Algonquian term, fancifully
rendered, &ldquo;inhabitants of the great wilderness.&rdquo; Among the
western Cherokee it is now the name of a powerful secret society, which
had its origin shortly before the War of the Rebellion.</p>
<p><i>Cherokee</i>&mdash;This name occurs in fully fifty different
spellings. In the standard recognized form, which dates back at least
to 1708, it has given name to counties in North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, within the ancient territory of the
tribe, and to as many as twenty other geographic locations within the
United States. In the Eastern or Lower dialect, with which the English
settlers first became familiar, the form is
Tsa&prime;r&#259;g&#301;&prime;, whence we get Cherokee. In the other
dialects the form is Tsa&prime;l&#259;g&#301;&prime;. It is evidently
foreign to the tribe, as is frequently the case in tribal names, and in
all probability is of Choctaw origin, having come up from the south
through the medium of the Mobilian trade jargon. It will be noted that
De Soto, whose chroniclers first use the word, in the form Chalaque,
obtained his interpreters from the Gulf coast of Florida. Fontanedo,
writing about the year 1575, mentions other inland tribes known to the
natives of Florida under names which seem to be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>of
Choctaw origin; for instance, the Canogacole, interpreted &ldquo;wicked
people,&rdquo; the final part being apparently the Choctaw word
<i>okla</i> or <i>ogula</i>, &ldquo;people&rdquo;, which appears also
in Pascagoula, Bayou Goula, and Pensacola. Shetimasha, Atakapa, and
probably Biloxi, are also Choctaw names, although the tribes themselves
are of other origins. As the Choctaw held much of the Gulf coast and
were the principal traders of that region, it was natural that
explorers landing among them should adopt their names for the more
remote tribes.</p>
<p>The name seems to refer to the fact that the tribe occupied a cave
country. In the &ldquo;Choctaw Leksikon&rdquo; of Allen Wright, 1880,
page 87, we find <i>choluk</i>, a noun, signifying a hole, cavity, pit,
chasm, etc., and as an adjective signifying hollow. In the manuscript
Choctaw dictionary of Cyrus Byington, in the library of the Bureau of
American Ethnology, we find <i>chiluk</i>, noun, a hole, cavity,
hollow, pit, etc., with a statement that in its usual application it
means a cavity or hollow, and not a hole through anything. As an
adjective, the same form is given as signifying hollow, having a hole,
as <i>iti chiluk</i>, a hollow tree; <i>aboha chiluk</i>, an empty
house; <i>chiluk chukoa</i>, to enter a hole. Other noun forms given
are <i>chuluk</i> and <i>achiluk</i> in the singular and
<i>chilukoa</i> in the plural, all signifying hole, pit, or cavity.
Verbal forms are <i>chilukikbi</i>, to make a hole, and
<i>chilukba</i>, to open and form a fissure.</p>
<p>In agreement with the genius of the Cherokee language the root form
of the tribal name takes nominal or verbal prefixes according to its
connection with the rest of the sentence, and is declined, or rather
conjugated, as follows: <span class="sc">Singular</span>&mdash;first
person, <i>tsi-Tsa&prime;l&#259;g&#301;</i>, I (am) a Cherokee; second
person, <i>hi-Tsa&prime;l&#259;g&#301;</i>, thou art a Cherokee; third
person, <i>a-Tsa&prime;l&#259;g&#301;</i>, he is a Cherokee.
<span class="sc">Dual</span>&mdash;first person,
<i>&acirc;sti-Tsa&prime;l&#259;g&#301;</i>, we two are Cherokee; second
person, <i>sti-Tsa&prime;l&#259;g&#301;</i>, you two are Cherokee;
third person, <i>ani&prime;-Tsa&prime;l&#259;g&#301;</i>, they two are
Cherokee. <span class="sc">Plural</span>&mdash;first person,
<i>atsi-Tsa&prime;l&#259;g&#301;</i>, we (several) are Cherokee; second
person, <i>hitsi-Tsa&prime;l&#259;g&#301;</i>, you (several) are
Cherokee; third person, <i>ani&prime;-Tsa&prime;l&#259;g&#301;</i>,
they (several) are Cherokee. It will be noticed that the third person
dual and plural are alike.</p>
<p><i>Oyata&#700;ge&#699;rono&ntilde;&#700;, etc.</i>&mdash;The
Iroquois (Mohawk) form is given by Hewitt as
O-yata&#700;-ge&#699;rono&ntilde;&#700;, of which the root is
<i>yata&#700;</i>, cave, <i>o</i> is the assertive prefix, <i>ge</i> is
the locative at, and <i>rono&ntilde;&#700;</i> is the tribal suffix,
equivalent to (English) <i>-ites</i> or people. The word, which has
several dialectic forms, signifies &ldquo;inhabitants of the cave
country,&rdquo; or &ldquo;cave-country people,&rdquo; rather than
&ldquo;people who dwell in caves,&rdquo; as rendered by Schoolcraft.
The same radix <i>yata&#700;</i> occurs also in the Iroquois name for
the opossum, which is a burrowing animal. As is well known, the
Allegheny region is peculiarly a cave country, the caves having been
used by the Indians for burial and shelter purposes, as is proved by
numerous remains found in them. It is probable that the Iroquois simply
translated the name (Chalaque) current in the South, as we find is the
case in the West, where the principal plains tribes are known under
translations of the same names in all the different languages. The
Wyandot name for the Cherokee, Wataiyo-rono&ntilde;&#700;, and their
Catawba name, Ma&ntilde;tera&ntilde;&prime;, both seem to refer to
coming out of the ground, and may have been originally intended to
convey the same idea of cave people.</p>
<p><i>Rickahockan</i>&mdash;This name is used by the German explorer,
Lederer, in 1670, as the name of the people inhabiting the mountains to
the southwest of the Virginia settlements. On his map he puts them in
the mountains on the southern head streams of Roanoke river, in western
North Carolina. He states that, according to his Indian informants, the
Rickahockan lived beyond the mountains in a land of great waves, which
he interpreted to mean the sea shore (!), but it is more likely that
the Indians were trying to convey, by means of the sign language, the
idea of a succession of mountain ridges. The name was probably of
Powhatan origin, and is evidently identical with Rechahecrian of the
Virginia chronicles of about the same period, the <i>r</i> in the
latter form being perhaps a misprint. It may be connected with
Righkahauk, indicated on Smith&rsquo;s map of Virginia, in 1607, as the
name of a town within the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href=
"#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>Powhatan territory, and still
preserved in Rockahock, the name of an estate on lower Pamunkey river.
We have too little material of the Powhatan language to hazard an
interpretation, but it may possibly contain the root of the word for
sand, which appears as <i>lekawa</i>, <i>nikawa</i>, <i>negaw</i>,
<i>rigawa</i>, <i>rekwa</i>, etc<span class="corr" id="xd25e5708"
title="Not in source">.</span>, in various eastern Algonquian dialects,
whence Rockaway (sand), and Recgawawank (sandy place). The Powhatan
form, as given by Strachey, is <i>racawh</i> (sand). He gives also
<i>rocoyhook</i> (otter), <i>reihcahahcoik</i>, hidden under a cloud,
overcast, <i>rickahone</i> or <i>reihcoan</i> (a comb), and
<i>rickewh</i> (to divide in halves).</p>
<p><i>Talligewi</i>&mdash;As Brinton well says: &ldquo;No name in the
Lenape&prime; legends has given rise to more extensive discussion than
this.&rdquo; On Colden&rsquo;s map in his &ldquo;History of the Five
Nations,&rdquo; 1727, we find the &ldquo;Alleghens&rdquo; indicated
upon Allegheny river. Heckewelder, who recorded the Delaware tradition
in 1819, says: &ldquo;Those people, as I was told, called themselves
Talligeu or Talligewi. Colonel John Gibson, however, a gentleman who
has a thorough knowledge of the Indians, and speaks several of their
languages, is of the opinion that they were not called Talligewi, but
Alligewi; and it would seem that he is right from the traces of their
name which still remain in the country, the Allegheny river and
mountains having indubitably been named after them. The Delawares still
call the former Alligewi Sipu (the river of the
Alligewi)&rdquo;&mdash;Indian Nations, p. 48, ed. 1876. Loskiel,
writing on the authority of Zeisberger, says that the Delawares knew
the whole country drained by the Ohio under the name of Alligewinengk,
meaning &ldquo;the land in which they arrived from distant
places,&rdquo; basing his interpretation upon an etymology compounded
from <i>talli</i> or <i>alli</i>, there, <i>icku</i>, to that place,
and <i>ewak</i>, they go, with a locative final. Ettwein, another
Moravian writer, says the Delawares called &ldquo;the western
country&rdquo; Alligewenork, meaning a warpath, and called the river
Alligewi Sipo. This definition would make the word come from
<i>palliton</i> or <i>alliton</i>, to fight, to make war, <i>ewak</i>,
they go, and a locative, i. e., &ldquo;they go there to fight.&rdquo;
Trumbull, an authority on Algonquian languages, derives the river name
from <i>wulik</i>, good, best, <i>hanne</i>, rapid stream, and
<i>sipu</i>, river, of which rendering its Iroquois name, <i>Ohio</i>,
is nearly an equivalent. Rafinesque renders Talligewi as &ldquo;there
found,&rdquo; from <i>talli</i>, there, and some other root, not given
(Brinton, Walam Olum, pp. 229&ndash;230, 1885).</p>
<p>It must be noted that the names Ohio and Alligewi (or Allegheny)
were not applied by the Indians, as with us, to different parts of the
same river, but to the whole stream, or at least the greater portion of
it from its head downward. Although Brinton sees no necessary
connection between the river name and the traditional tribal name, the
statement of Heckewelder, generally a competent authority on Delaware
matters, makes them identical.</p>
<p>In the traditional tribal name, Talligewi or Alligewi, <i>wi</i> is
an assertive verbal suffix, so that the form properly means &ldquo;he
is a Tallige,&rdquo; or &ldquo;they are Tallige.&rdquo; This comes very
near to Tsa&prime;l&#259;g&#301;&prime;, the name by which the Cherokee
call themselves, and it may have been an early corruption of that name.
In Zeisberger&rsquo;s Delaware dictionary, however, we find
<i>waloh</i> or <i>walok</i>, signifying a cave or hole, while in the
&ldquo;Walam Olum&rdquo; we have <i>oligonunk</i> rendered &ldquo;at
the place of caves,&rdquo; the region being further described as a
buffalo land on a pleasant plain, where the Lenape&prime;, advancing
seaward from a less abundant northern region, at last found food (Walam
Olum, pp. 194&ndash;195). Unfortunately, like other aboriginal
productions of its kind among the northern tribes, the Lenape chronicle
is suggestive rather than complete and connected. With more light it
may be that seeming discrepancies would disappear and we should find at
last that the Cherokee, in ancient times as in the historic period,
were always the southern vanguard of the Iroquoian race, always
primarily a mountain people, but with their flank resting upon the Ohio
and its great tributaries, following the trend of the Blue ridge and
the Cumberland as they slowly gave way before the pressure from the
north until they were finally cut off from the parent stock by the
wedge of Algonquian invasion, but always, whether in the north
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>or in the south, keeping their distinctive title
among the tribes as the &ldquo;people of the cave country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Cherokee have occupied a prominent place in history for so
long a period their name appears in many synonyms and diverse
spellings. The following are among the principal of these:</p>

<p>(2) <span class="sc">Mobilian trade language</span> (page 16): This
trade jargon, based upon Choctaw, but borrowing also from all the
neighboring dialects and even from the more northern Algonquian
languages, was spoken and understood among all the tribes of the Gulf
states, probably as far west as Matagorda bay and northward along both
banks of the Mississippi to the Algonquian frontier about the entrance
of the Ohio. It was called Mobilienne by the French, from Mobile, the
great trading center of the Gulf region. Along the Mississippi it was
sometimes known also as the Chickasaw trade language, the Chickasaw
being a dialect of the Choctaw language proper. Jeffreys, in 1761,
compares this jargon in its uses to the lingua franca of the Levant,
and it was evidently by the aid of this intertribal medium that De
Soto&rsquo;s interpreter from Tampa bay could converse with all the
tribes they met until they reached the Mississippi. Some of the names
used by Fontanedo about 1575 for the tribes northward from Appalachee
bay seem to be derived from this source, as in later times were the
names of the other tribes of the Gulf region, without regard to
linguistic affinities, including among others the Taensa, Tunica,
Atakapa, and Shetimasha, representing as many different linguistic
stocks. In his report upon the southwestern tribes in 1805, Sibley says
that the &ldquo;Mobilian&rdquo; was spoken in addition to their native
languages by all the Indians who had come from the east side of the
Mississippi. Among those so using it he names the Alabama, Apalachi,
Biloxi, Chactoo, Pacana, Pascagula, Taensa, and Tunica. Woodward,
writing from Louisiana more than fifty years later, says: &ldquo;There
is yet a language the Texas Indians call the Mobilian tongue, that has
been the trading language of almost all the tribes that have inhabited
the country. I know white men that now speak it. There is a man now
living near me that is fifty years of age, raised in Texas, that speaks
the language well. It is a mixture of Creek, Choctaw, Chickasay,
Netches [Natchez], and Apelash [Apalachi]&rdquo;&mdash;Reminiscences,
79. For further information see also Gatschet, Creek Migration Legend,
and Sibley, Report.</p>
<p>The Mobilian trade jargon was not unique of its kind. In America, as
in other parts of the world, the common necessities of
intercommunication have resulted in the formation of several such
mongrel dialects, prevailing, sometimes over wide areas. In some cases,
also, the language of a predominant tribe serves as the common medium
for all the tribes of a particular region. In South America we find the
lingoa geral, based upon the Tupi&prime; language, understood for
everyday purposes by all the tribes of the immense central region from
Guiana to Paraguay, including almost the whole Amazon basin. On the
northwest coast we find the well-known &ldquo;Chinook jargon,&rdquo;
which takes its name from a small tribe formerly residing at the mouth
of the Columbia, in common use among all the tribes from California far
up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>into Alaska, and eastward to the great divide of
the Rocky mountains. In the southwest the Navaho-Apache language is
understood by nearly all the Indians of Arizona and New Mexico, while
on the plains the Sioux language in the north and the Comanche in the
south hold almost the same position. In addition to these we have also
the noted &ldquo;sign language,&rdquo; a gesture system used and
perfectly understood as a fluent means of communication among all the
hunting tribes of the plains from the Saskatchewan to the Rio
Grande.</p>
<p>(3) <span class="sc">Dialects</span> (page 17): The linguistic
affinity of the Cherokee and northern Iroquoian dialects, although now
well established, is not usually obvious on the surface, but requires a
close analysis of words, with a knowledge of the laws of phonetic
changes, to make it appear. The superficial agreement is perhaps most
apparent between the Mohawk and the Eastern (Lower) Cherokee dialects,
as both of these lack the labials entirely and use <i>r</i> instead of
<i>l</i>. In the short table given below the Iroquois words are taken,
with slight changes in the alphabet used, from Hewitt&rsquo;s

<p>It will be noted that the Eastern and Middle dialects are about the
same, excepting for the change of <i>l</i> to <i>r</i>, and the entire
absence of the labial <i>m</i> from the Eastern dialect, while the
Western differs considerably from the others, particularly in the
greater frequency of the liquid <i>l</i> and the softening of the
guttural <i>g</i>, the changes tending to render it the most musical of
all the Cherokee dialects. It is also the standard literary dialect. In
addition to these three principal dialects there are some peculiar
forms and expressions in use by a few individuals which indicate the
former existence of one or more other dialects now too far extinct to
be reconstructed. As in most other tribes, the ceremonial forms used by
the priesthood are so filled with archaic and figurative expressions as
to be almost unintelligible to the laity.</p>

<p>Tradition and history alike point to the St. Lawrence region as the
early home of this stock. Upon this point all authorities concur. Says
Hale, in his paper on Indian Migrations (p. 4): &ldquo;The constant
tradition of the Iroquois represents their ancestors as emigrants from
the region north of the Great lakes, where they dwelt in early times
with their Huron brethren. This tradition is recorded with much
particularity by Cadwallader Colden, surveyor-general of New York, who
in the early part of the last century composed his well known
&lsquo;History of the Five Nations.&rsquo; It is told in a somewhat
different form by David Cusick, the Tuscarora historian, in his
&lsquo;Sketches of Ancient History of the Six Nations,&rsquo; and it is
repeated by Mr. L. H. Morgan in his now classical work, &lsquo;The
League of the Iroquois,&rsquo; for which he procured his information
chiefly among the Senecas. Finally, as we learn from the narrative of
the Wyandot Indian, Peter Clarke, in his book entitled &lsquo;Origin
and Traditional History of the Wyandotts,&rsquo; the belief of the
Hurons accords in this respect with that of the Iroquois. Both point
alike to the country immediately north of the St. Lawrence, and
especially to that portion of it lying east of Lake Ontario, as the
early home of the Huron-Iroquois nations.&rdquo; Nothing is known of
the traditions of the Conestoga or the Nottoway, but the tradition of
the Tuscarora, as given by Cusick and other authorities, makes them a
direct offshoot from the northern Iroquois, with whom they afterward
reunited. The traditions of the Cherokee also, as we have seen, bring
them from the north, thus completing the cycle. &ldquo;The striking
fact has become evident that the course of migration of the
Huron-Cherokee family has been from the northeast to the
southwest&mdash;that is, from eastern Canada, on the Lower St.
Lawrence, to the mountains of northern Alabama.&rdquo;&mdash;Hale,
Indian Migrations, p. 11.</p>
<p>The retirement of the northern Iroquoian tribes from the St.
Lawrence region was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190"
name="pb190">190</a>]</span>due to the hostility of their Algonquian
neighbors, by whom the Hurons and their allies were forced to take
refuge about Georgian bay and the head of Lake Ontario, while the
Iroquois proper retreated to central New York. In 1535 Cartier found
the shores of the river from Quebec to Montreal occupied by an
Iroquoian people, but on the settlement of the country seventy years
later the same region was found in possession of Algonquian tribes. The
confederation of the five Iroquois nations, probably about the year
1540, enabled them to check the Algonquian invasion and to assume the
offensive. Linguistic and other evidence shows that the separation of
the Cherokee from the parent stock must have far antedated this
period.</p>
<p>(5) <span class="sc">Walam Olum</span> (p. <a href="#pb18" class=
"pageref">18</a>): The name signifies &ldquo;red score,&rdquo; from the
Delaware <i>walam</i>, &ldquo;painted,&rdquo; more particularly
&ldquo;painted red,&rdquo; and <i>olum</i>, &ldquo;a score,
tally-mark.&rdquo; The Walam Olum was first published in 1836 in a work
entitled &ldquo;The American Nations,&rdquo; by Constantine Samuel
Rafinesque, a versatile and voluminous, but very erratic, French
scholar, who spent the latter half of his life in this country, dying
in Philadelphia in 1840. He asserted that it was a translation of a
manuscript in the Delaware language, which was an interpretation of an
ancient sacred metrical legend of the Delawares, recorded in
pictographs cut upon wood, obtained in 1820 by a medical friend of his
among the Delawares then living in central Indiana. He says himself:
&ldquo;These actual <i>olum</i> were first obtained in 1820 as a reward
for a medical cure, deemed a curiosity, and were unexplicable. In 1822
were obtained from another individual the songs annexed thereto in the
original language, but no one could be found by me able to translate
them. I had therefore to learn the language since, by the help of
Zeisberger, Heckewelder, and a manuscript dictionary, on purpose to
translate them, which I only accomplished in 1833.&rdquo; On account of
the unique character of the alleged Indian record and
Rafinesque&rsquo;s own lack of standing among his scientific
contemporaries, but little attention was paid to the discovery until
Brinton took up the subject a few years ago. After a critical sifting
of the evidence from every point of view he arrived at the conclusion
that the work is a genuine native production, although the manuscript
rendering is faulty, partly from the white scribe&rsquo;s ignorance of
the language and partly from the Indian narrator&rsquo;s ignorance of
the meaning of the archaic forms. Brinton&rsquo;s edition (q. v.),
published from Rafinesque&rsquo;s manuscript, gives the legend in
triplicate form&mdash;pictograph, Delaware, and English translation,
with notes and glossary, and a valuable ethnologic introduction by
Brinton himself.</p>
<p>It is not known that any of the original woodcut pictographs of the
Walam Olum are now in existence, although a statement of Rafinesque
implies that he had seen them. As evidence of the truth of his
statement, however, we have the fact that precisely similar
pictographic series cut upon birch bark, each pictograph representing a
line or couplet of a sacred metrical recitation, are now known to be
common among the Ojibwa, Menomini, and other northern tribes. In 1762 a
Delaware prophet recorded his visions in hieroglyphics cut upon a
wooden stick, and about the year 1827 a Kickapoo reformer adopted the
same method to propagate a new religion among the tribes. One of these
&ldquo;prayer sticks&rdquo; is now in the National Museum, being all
that remains of a large basketful delivered to a missionary in Indiana
by a party of Kickapoo Indians in 1830 (see plate and description, pp.
665, 697 <i>et seq.</i> in the author&rsquo;s Ghost-dance Religion,
Fourteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology).</p>
<p>(6) <span class="sc">Fish river</span> (p. <a href="#pb18" class=
"pageref">18</a>): Nam&aelig;si Sipu (Heckewelder, Indian Nations, 49),
or Namassipi (Walam Olum, p. 198). Deceived by a slight similarity of
sound, Heckewelder makes this river identical with the Mississippi, but
as Schoolcraft shows (Notes on Iroquois, p. 316) the true name of the
Mississippi is simply Misi-sipi, &ldquo;great river,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;fish river&rdquo; would be a most inappropriate name for such a
turbulent current, where only the coarser species can live. The mere
fact that there can be a question of identity among experts familiar
with Indian nomenclature would indicate that it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>was
not one of the larger streams. Although Heckewelder makes the Alligewi,
as he prefers to call them, flee down the Mississippi after their final
defeat, the Walam Olum chronicle says only &ldquo;all the Talega go
south.&rdquo; It was probably a gradual withdrawal, rather than a
sudden and concerted flight (see Hale, Indian Migrations, pp.
19&ndash;22).</p>
<p>(7) <span class="sc">First appearance of whites</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb19" class="pageref">19</a>): It is possible that this may refer to
one of the earlier adventurers who coasted along the North Atlantic in
the first decades after the discovery of America, among whom were
Sebastian Cabot, in 1498; Verrazano, in 1524; and Gomez, in 1525. As
these voyages were not followed up by permanent occupation of the
country it is doubtful if they made any lasting impression upon Indian
tradition. The author has chosen to assume, with Brinton and
Rafinesque, that the Walam Olum reference is to the settlement of the
Dutch at New York and the English in Virginia soon after 1600.</p>
<p id="hn8">(8) <span class="sc">De Soto&rsquo;s route</span> (p.
<a href="#pb26" class="pageref">26</a>): On May 30, 1539, Hernando de
Soto, of Spain, with 600 armed men and 213 horses, landed at Tampa bay,
on the west coast of Florida, in search of gold. After more than four
years of hardship and disappointed wandering from Florida to the great
plains of the West and back again to the Mississippi, where De Soto
died and his body was consigned to the great river, 311 men, all that
were left of the expedition, arrived finally at P&aacute;nuco, in
Mexico, on September 10, 1543.</p>
<p>For the history of this expedition, the most important ever
undertaken by Spain within eastern United States, we have four original
authorities. First is the very brief, but evidently truthful (Spanish)
report of Biedma, an officer of the expedition, presented to the King
in 1544, immediately after the return to Spain. Next in order, but of
first importance for detail and general appearance of reliability, is
the narrative of an anonymous Portuguese cavalier of the expedition,
commonly known as the Gentleman of Elvas, originally published in the
Portuguese language in 1557. Next comes the (Spanish) narrative of
Garcilaso, written, but not published, in 1587. Unlike the others, the
author was not an eyewitness of what he describes, but made up his
account chiefly from the oral recollections of an old soldier of the
expedition more than forty years after the event, this information
being supplemented from papers written by two other soldiers of De
Soto. As might be expected, the Garcilaso narrative, although written
in flowery style, abounds in exaggeration and trivial incident, and
compares unfavorably with the other accounts, while probably giving
more of the minor happenings. The fourth original account is an
unfinished (Spanish) report by Ranjel, secretary of the expedition,
written soon after reaching Mexico, and afterward incorporated with
considerable change by Oviedo, in his &ldquo;<span lang="es">Historia
natural y general de las Indias.</span>&rdquo; As this fourth narrative
remained unpublished until 1851 and has never been translated, it has
hitherto been entirely overlooked by the commentators, excepting
Winsor, who notes it incidentally. In general it agrees well with the
Elvas narrative and throws valuable light upon the history of the
expedition.</p>
<p>The principal authorities, while preserving a general unity of
narrative, differ greatly in detail, especially in estimates of numbers
and distances, frequently to such an extent that it is useless to
attempt to reconcile their different statements. In general the
Gentleman of Elvas is most moderate in his expression, while Biedma
takes a middle ground and Garcilaso exaggerates greatly. Thus the first
named gives De Soto 600 men, Biedma makes the number 620, while
Garcilaso says 1,000. At a certain stage of the journey the Portuguese
Gentleman gives De Soto 700 Indians as escort, Biedma says 800, while
Garcilaso makes it 8,000. At the battle of Mavilla the Elvas account
gives 18 Spaniards and 2,500 Indians killed, Biedma says 20 Spaniards
killed, without giving an estimate of the Indians, while Garcilaso has
82 Spaniards and over 11,000 Indians killed. In distances there is as
great discrepancy. Thus Biedma makes the distance from Guaxule to
Chiaha four days, Garcilaso has it six days, and Elvas seven days. As
to the length of an average day&rsquo;s march we find it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>estimated all the way from &ldquo;four leagues,
more or less&rdquo; (Garcilaso) to &ldquo;every day seven or eight
leagues&rdquo; (Elvas). In another place the Elvas chronicler states
that they usually made five or six leagues a day through inhabited
territories, but that in crossing uninhabited regions&mdash;as that
between Canasagua and Chiaha, they marched every day as far as possible
for fear of running out of provisions. One of the most glaring
discrepancies appears in regard to the distance between Chiaha and
Coste. Both the Portuguese writer and Garcilaso put Chiaha upon an
island&mdash;a statement which in itself is at variance with any
present conditions,&mdash;but while the former makes the island a
fraction over a league in length the latter says that it was five
leagues long. The next town was Coste, which Garcilaso puts immediately
at the lower end of the same island while the Portuguese Gentleman
represents it as seven days distant, although he himself has given the
island the shorter length.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding a deceptive appearance of exactness, especially in
the Elvas and Ranjel narratives, which have the form of a daily
journal, the conclusion is irresistible that much of the record was
made after dates had been forgotten, and the sequence of events had
become confused. Considering all the difficulties, dangers, and
uncertainties that constantly beset the expedition, it would be too
much to expect the regularity of a ledger, and it is more probable that
the entries were made, not from day to day, but at irregular intervals
as opportunity presented at the several resting places. The story must
be interpreted in the light of our later knowledge of the geography and
ethnology of the country traversed.</p>
<p>Each of the three principal narratives has passed through
translations and later editions of more or less doubtful fidelity to
the original, the English edition in some cases being itself a
translation from an earlier French or Dutch translation. English
speaking historians of the expedition have usually drawn their material
from one or the other of these translations, without knowledge of the
original language, of the etymologies of the Indian names or the
relations of the various tribes mentioned, or of the general system of
Indian geographic nomenclature. One of the greatest errors has been the
attempt to give in every case a fixed local habitation to a name which
in some instances is not a proper name at all, and in others is merely
a descriptive term or a duplicate name occurring at several places in
the same tribal territory. Thus Tali is simply the Creek word
<i>talua</i>, town, and not a definite place name as represented by a
mistake natural in dealing through interpreters with an unknown Indian
language. Tallise and Tallimuchase are respectively &ldquo;Old
town&rdquo; and &ldquo;New town&rdquo; in Creek, and there can be no
certainty that the same names were applied to the same places a century
later. Canasagua is a corruption of a Cherokee name which occurs in at
least three other places in the old Cherokee country in addition to the
one mentioned in the narrative, and almost every old Indian local name
was thus repeated several times, as in the case of such common names as
Short creek, Whitewater, Richmond, or Lexington among ourselves. The
fact that only one name of the set has been retained on the map does
not prove its identity with the town of the old chronicle. Again such
loose terms as &ldquo;a large river,&rdquo; &ldquo;a beautiful
valley,&rdquo; have been assumed to mean something more definitely
localized than the wording warrants. The most common error in
translation has been the rendering of the Spanish
&ldquo;despoblado&rdquo; as &ldquo;desert.&rdquo; There are no deserts
in the Gulf states, and the word means simply an uninhabited region,
usually the debatable strip between two tribes.</p>
<p>There have been many attempts to trace De Soto&rsquo;s route. As
nearly every historian who has written of the southern states has given
attention to this subject it is unnecessary to enumerate them all. Of
some thirty works consulted by the author, in addition to the original
narratives already mentioned, not more than two or three can be
considered as speaking with any authority, the rest simply copying from
these without investigation. The first attempt to locate the route
definitely was made by Meek (Romantic Passages, etc.) in 1839
(reprinted in 1857), his conclusions being <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>based upon his general knowledge of the
geography of the region. In 1851 Pickett tried to locate the route,
chiefly, he asserts, from Indian tradition as related by mixed-bloods.
How much dependence can be placed upon Indian tradition as thus
interpreted three centuries after the event it is unnecessary to say.
Both these writers have brought De Soto down the Coosa river, in which
they have been followed without investigation by Irving, Shea and
others, but none of these was aware of the existence of a Suwali tribe,
or correctly acquainted with the Indian nomenclature of the upper
country, or of the Creek country as so well summarized by Gatschet in
his Creek Migration Legend. They are also mistaken in assuming that
only De Soto passed through the country, whereas we now know that
several Spanish explorers and numerous French adventurers traversed the
same territory, the latest expeditions of course being freshest in
Indian memory. Jones in his &ldquo;De Soto&rsquo;s March Through
Georgia&rdquo; simply dresses up the earlier statements in more
literary style, sometimes changing surmises to positive assertions,
without mentioning his authorities. Maps of the supposed route, all
bringing De Soto down the Coosa instead of the Chattahoochee, have been
published in Irving&rsquo;s Conquest of Florida, the Hakluyt
Society&rsquo;s edition of the Gentleman of Elva&rsquo;s account, and
in Buckingham Smith&rsquo;s translation of the same narrative, as well
as in several other works. For the eastern portion, with which we have
to deal, all of these are practically duplicates of one another. On
several old Spanish and French maps the names mentioned in the
narrative seem to have been set down merely to fill space, without much
reference to the text of the chronicle. For a list and notices of
principal writers who have touched upon this subject see the appendix
to Shea&rsquo;s chapter on &ldquo;Ancient Florida&rdquo; in
Winsor&rsquo;s Narrative and Critical History of America, <span class=
"sc">II</span>; Boston, 1886. We shall speak only of that part of the
route which lay near the Cherokee mountains.</p>
<p>The first location which concerns us in the narrative is
Cofitachiqui, the town from which De Soto set out for the Cherokee
country. The name appears variously as Cofitachequi (Ranjel),
Cofitachique (Biedma), Cofachiqui (Garcilaso), Cutifa-Chiqui (by
transposition, Elvas), Cofeta&ccedil;que (Vandera), Catafachique
(Williams) and Cosatachiqui (misprint, Brooks MSS), and the Spaniards
first heard of the region as Yupaha from a tribe farther to the south.
The correct form appears to be that first given, which Gatschet, from
later information than that quoted in his Creek Migration Legend, makes
a Hitchitee word about equivalent to &ldquo;Dogwood town,&rdquo; from
<i>cofi</i>, &ldquo;dogwood,&rdquo; <i>cofita</i>, &ldquo;dogwood
thicket,&rdquo; and <i>chiki</i>, &ldquo;house,&rdquo; or collectively
&ldquo;town.&rdquo; McCulloch puts the town upon the headwaters of the
Ocmulgee; Williams locates it on the Chattahoochee; Gallatin on the
Oconee or the Savannah; Meek and Monette, following him, probably in
the fork of the Savannah and the Broad; Pickett, with Jones and others
following him, at Silver bluff on the east (north) bank of the
Savannah, in Barnwell county, South Carolina, about 25 miles by water
below the present Augusta. It will thus be seen that at the very outset
of our inquiry the commentators differ by a distance equal to more than
half the width of the state of Georgia. It will suffice here to say,
without going into the argument, that the author is inclined to believe
that the Indian town was on or near Silver bluff, which was noted for
its extensive ancient remains as far back as Bartram&rsquo;s time
(Travels, 313), and where the noted George Galphin established a
trading post in 1736. The original site has since been almost entirely
worn away by the river. According to the Indians of Cofitachiqui, the
town, which was on the farther (north) bank of the stream, was two
day&rsquo;s journey from the sea, probably by canoe, and the sailors
with the expedition believed the river to be the same one that entered
at St. Helena, which was a very close guess. The Spaniards were shown
here European articles which they were told had been obtained from
white men who had entered the river&rsquo;s mouth many years before.
These they conjectured to have been the men with Ayllon, who had landed
on that coast in 1520 and again in 1524. The town was probably the
ancient capital of the Uchee Indians, who, before their absorption by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>the Creeks, held or claimed most of the
territory on both banks of Savannah river from the Cherokee border to
within about forty miles of Savannah and westward to the Ogeechee and
Cannouchee rivers (see Gatschet, Creek Migration Legend, <span class=
"sc">I</span>, 17&ndash;24). The country was already on the decline in
1540 from a recent fatal epidemic, but was yet populous and wealthy,
and was ruled by a woman chief whose authority extended for a
considerable distance. The town was visited also by Pardo in 1567 and
again by Torres in 1628, when it was still a principal settlement, as
rich in pearls as in De Soto&rsquo;s time (Brooks MSS, in the archives
of the Bureau of American Ethnology).</p>
<p>Somewhere in southern Georgia De Soto had been told of a rich
province called Co&ccedil;a (Coosa, the Creek country) toward the
northwest. At Cofitachiqui he again heard of it and of one of its
principal towns called Chiaha (Chehaw) as being twelve days inland.
Although on first hearing of it he had kept on in the other direction
in order to reach Cofitachiqui, he now determined to go there, and made
the queen a prisoner to compel her to accompany him a part of the way
as guide. Co&ccedil;a province was, though he did not know it, almost
due west, and he was in haste to reach it in order to obtain corn, as
his men and horses were almost worn out from hunger. It is apparent,
however, that the unwilling queen, afraid of being carried beyond her
own territories, led the Spaniards by a roundabout route in the hope of
making her escape, as she finally did, or perhaps of leaving them to
starve and die in the mountains, precisely the trick attempted by the
Indians upon another Spanish adventurer, Coronado, entering the great
plains from the Pacific coast in search of golden treasure in the same
year.</p>
<p>Instead therefore of recrossing the river to the westward, the
Spaniards, guided by the captive queen, took the direction of the north
(&ldquo;<span lang="es">la vuelta del
norte</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Biedma), and, after passing through several
towns subject to the queen, came in seven days to &ldquo;the province
of Chalaque&rdquo; (Elvas). Elvas, Garcilaso, and Ranjel agree upon the
spelling, but the last named makes the distance only two days from
Cofitachiqui. Biedma does not mention the country at all. The trifling
difference in statement of five days in seven need not trouble us, as
Biedma makes the whole distance from Cofitachiqui to Xuala eight days,
and from Guaxule to Chiaha four days, where Elvas makes it,
respectively, twelve and seven days. Chalaque is, of course, Cherokee,
as all writers agree, and De Soto was now probably on the waters of
Keowee river, the eastern head stream of Savannah river, where the
Lower Cherokee had their towns. Finding the country bare of corn, he
made no stay.</p>
<p>Proceeding six days farther they came next to Guaquili, where they
were kindly received. This name occurs only in the Ranjel narrative,
the other three being entirely silent in regard to such a halting
place. The name has a Cherokee sound (Wakili), but if we allow for a
dialectic substitution of <i>l</i> for <i>r</i> it may be connected
with such Catawba names as Congaree, Wateree, and Sugeree. It was
probably a village of minor importance.</p>
<p>They came next to the province of Xuala, or Xualla, as the Elvas
narrative more often has it. In a French edition it appears as Chouala.
Ranjel makes it three days from Guaquili or five from Chalaque. Elvas
also makes it five days from Chalaque, while Biedma makes it eight days
from Cofitachiqui, a total discrepancy of four days from the last-named
place. Biedma describes it as a rough mountain country, thinly
populated, but with a few Indian houses, and thinks that in these
mountains the great river of Espiritu Santo (the Mississippi) had its
birth. Ranjel describes the town as situated in a plain in the vicinity
of rivers and in a country with greater appearance of gold mines than
any they had yet seen. The Portuguese gentleman describes it as having
very little corn, and says that they reached it from Cofitachiqui over
a hilly country. In his final chapter he states that the course from
Cofitachiqui to this place was from south to north, thus agreeing with
Biedma. According to Garcilaso (pp. 136&ndash;137) it was fifty leagues
by the road along which the Spaniards had come from Cofitachiqui to the
first valley of the province of Xuala, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb195" href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>with but few
mountains on the way, and the town itself was situated close under a
mountain (&ldquo;a la falda de una sierra&rdquo;) beside a small but
rapid stream which formed the boundary of the territory of Cofitachiqui
in this direction. From Ranjel we learn that on the same day after
leaving this place for the next &ldquo;province&rdquo; the Spaniards
crossed a very high mountain ridge (&ldquo;una sierra muy
alta&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Without mentioning the name, Pickett (1851) refers to Xuala as
&ldquo;a town in the present Habersham county, Georgia,&rdquo; but
gives no reason for this opinion. Rye and Irving, of the same date,
arguing from a slight similarity of name, think it may have been on the
site of a former Cherokee town, Qualatchee, on the head of
Chattahoochee river in Georgia. The resemblance, however, is rather
farfetched, and moreover this same name is found on Keowee river in
South Carolina. Jones (De Soto in Georgia, 1880) interprets
Garcilaso&rsquo;s description to refer to &ldquo;Nacoochee valley,
Habersham county&rdquo;&mdash;which should be White county&mdash;and
the neighboring Mount Yonah, overlooking the fact that the same
description of mountain, valley, and swift flowing stream might apply
equally well to any one of twenty other localities in this southern
mountain country. With direct contradiction Garcilaso says that the
Spaniards rested here fifteen days because they found provisions
plentiful, while the Portuguese Gentleman says that they stopped but
two days because they found so little corn! Ranjel makes them stop four
days and says they found abundant provisions and assistance.</p>
<p>However that may have been, there can be no question of the identity
of the name. As the province of Chalaque is the country of the
Cherokee, so the province of Xuala is the territory of the Suwali or
Sara Indians, better known later as Cheraw, who lived in early times in
the piedmont country about the head of Broad river in North Carolina,
adjoining the Cherokee, who still remember them under the name of
Ani&prime;-Suwa&prime;li. A principal trail to their country from the
west led up Swannanoa river and across the gap which, for this reason,
was known to the Cherokee as Suwa&prime;li-nu&ntilde;n&acirc;,
&ldquo;Suwali trail,&rdquo; corrupted by the whites to Swannanoa.
Lederer, who found them in the same general region in 1670, calls this
gap the &ldquo;Suala pass&rdquo; and the neighboring mountains the Sara
mountains, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;The Spaniards make
Suala.&rdquo; They afterward shifted to the north and finally returned
and were incorporated with the Catawba (see Mooney, Siouan Tribes of
the East, bulletin of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1894).</p>
<p>Up to this point the Spaniards had followed a north course from
Cofitachiqui (Biedma and Elvas), but they now turned to the west
(Elvas, final chapter). On the same day on which they left Xuala they
crossed &ldquo;a very high mountain ridge,&rdquo; and descended the
next day to a wide meadow bottom (&ldquo;savana&rdquo;), through which
flowed a river which they concluded was a part of the Espiritu Santo,
the Mississippi (Ranjel). Biedma speaks of crossing a mountain country
and mentions the river, which he also says they thought to be a
tributary of the Mississippi. Garcilaso says that this portion of their
route was through a mountain country without inhabitants
(&ldquo;despoblado&rdquo;) and the Portuguese gentleman describes it as
being over &ldquo;very rough and high ridges.&rdquo; In five days of
such travel&mdash;for here, for a wonder, all the narratives
agree&mdash;they came to Guaxule. This is the form given by Garcilaso
and the Gentleman of Elvas; Biedma has Guasula, and Ranjel Guasili or
Guasuli. The translators and commentators have given us such forms as
Guachoule, Quaxule, Quaxulla, and Quexale. According to the Spanish
method of writing Indian words the name was pronounced Washul&eacute;
or Wasuli, which has a Cherokee sound, although it can not be
translated. Buckingham Smith (Narratives, p. 222) hints that the
Spaniards may have changed Guasili to Guasule, because of the
similarity of the latter form to a town name in southern Spain. Such
corruptions of Indian names are of frequent occurrence. Garcilaso
speaks of it as a &ldquo;province and town,&rdquo; while Biedma and
Ranjel call it simply a town (&ldquo;pueblo&rdquo;). Before reaching
this place the Indian queen had managed to make her escape. All the
chroniclers tell of the kind reception <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb196" href="#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>which the Spaniards
met here, but the only description of the town itself is from
Garcilaso, who says that it was situated in the midst of many small
streams which came down from the mountains round about, that it
consisted of three hundred houses, which is probably an exaggeration,
though it goes to show that the village was of considerable size, and
that the chief&rsquo;s house, in which the principal officers were
lodged, was upon a high hill (&ldquo;un cerro alto&rdquo;), around
which was a roadway (&ldquo;paseadero&rdquo;) wide enough for six men
to walk abreast. By the &ldquo;chief&rsquo;s house&rdquo; we are to
understand the town-house, while from various similar references in
other parts of the narrative there can be no doubt that the
&ldquo;hill&rdquo; upon which it stood was an artificial mound. In
modern Spanish writing such artificial elevations are more often called
<i>lomas</i>, but these early adventurers may be excused for not noting
the distinction. Issuing from the mountains round about the town were
numerous small streams, which united to form the river which the
Spaniards henceforth followed from here down to Chiaha, where it was as
large as the Guadalquivir at Sevilla (Garcilaso).</p>
<p>Deceived by the occurrence, in the Portuguese narrative, of the name
Canasagua, which they assumed could belong in but one place, earlier
commentators have identified this river with the Coosa, Pickett putting
Guaxule somewhere upon its upper waters, while Jones improves upon this
by making the site &ldquo;identical, or very nearly so, with
Coosawattee Old town, in the southeastern corner of Murray
county,&rdquo; Georgia. As we shall show, however, the name in question
was duplicated in several states, and a careful study of the
narratives, in the light of present knowledge of the country, makes it
evident that the river was not the Coosa, but the Chattahoochee.</p>
<p>Turning our attention once more to Xuala, the most northern point
reached by De Soto, we have seen that this was the territory of the
Suwala or Sara Indians, in the eastern foothills of the Alleghenies,
about the head waters of Broad and Catawba rivers, in North Carolina.
As the Spaniards turned here to the west they probably did not
penetrate far beyond the present South Carolina boundary. The
&ldquo;very high mountain ridge&rdquo; which they crossed immediately
after leaving the town was in all probability the main chain of the
Blue ridge, while the river which they found after descending to the
savanna on the other side, and which they guessed to be a branch of the
Mississippi, was almost as certainly the upper part of the French
Broad, the first stream flowing in an opposite direction from those
which they had previously encountered. They may have struck it in the
neighborhood of Hendersonville or Brevard, there being two gaps,
passable for vehicles, in the main ridge eastward from the first-named
town. The uninhabited mountains through which they struggled for
several days on their way to Chiaha and Co&ccedil;a (the Creek country)
in the southwest were the broken ridges in which the Savannah and the
Little Tennessee have their sources, and if they followed an Indian
trail they may have passed through the Rabun gap, near the present
Clayton, Georgia. Guaxule, and not Xuala, as Jones supposes, was in
Nacoochee valley, in the present White county, Georgia, and the small
streams which united to form the river down which the Spaniards
proceeded to Chiaha were the headwaters of the Chattahoochee. The hill
upon which the townhouse was built must have been the great Nacoochee
mound, the most prominent landmark in the valley, on the east bank of
Sautee creek, in White county, about twelve miles northwest of
Clarkesville. This is the largest mound in upper Georgia, with the
exception of the noted Etowah mound near Cartersville, and is the only
one which can fill the requirements of the case. There are but two
considerable mounds in western North Carolina, that at Franklin and a
smaller one on Oconaluftee river, on the present East Cherokee
reservation, and as both of these are on streams flowing away from the
Creek country, this fact alone would bar them from consideration. The
only large mounds in upper Georgia are this one at Nacoochee and the
group on the Etowah river, near Cartersville. The largest of the Etowah
group is some fifty feet in height and is ascended on one side by means
of a roadway <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>about fifty feet wide at the base and narrowing
gradually to the top. Had this been the mound of the narrative it is
hardly possible that the chronicler would have failed to notice also
the two other mounds of the group or the other one on the opposite side
of the river, each of these being from twenty to twenty-five feet in
height, to say nothing of the great ditch a quarter of a mile in length
which encircles the group. Moreover, Cartersville is at some distance
from the mountains, and the Etowah river at this point does not answer
the description of a small rushing mountain stream. There is no
considerable mound at Coosawatee or in any of the three counties
adjoining.</p>
<p>The Nacoochee mound has been cleared and cultivated for many years
and does not now show any appearance of a roadway up the side, but from
its great height we may be reasonably sure that some such means of easy
ascent existed in ancient times. In other respects it is the only mound
in the whole upper country which fills the conditions. The valley is
one of the most fertile spots in Georgia and numerous ancient remains
give evidence that it was a favorite center of settlement in early
days. At the beginning of the modern historic period it was held by the
Cherokee, who had there a town called Nacoochee, but their claim was
disputed by the Creeks. The Gentleman of Elvas states that Guaxule was
subject to the queen of Cofitachiqui, but this may mean only that the
people of the two towns or tribes were in friendly alliance. The modern
name is pronounced <i>Nagu&#699;ts&#301;&prime;</i> by the Cherokee,
who say, however, that it is not of their language. The terminal may be
the Creek <i>udshi</i>, &ldquo;small,&rdquo; or it may have a
connection with the name of the Uchee Indians.</p>
<p>From Guaxule the Spaniards advanced to Canasoga (Ranjel) or
Canasagua (Elvas), one or two days&rsquo; march from Guaxule, according
to one or the other authority. Garcilaso and Biedma do not mention the
name. As Garcilaso states that from Guaxule to Chiaha the march was
down the bank of the same river, which we identify with the
Chattahoochee, the town may have been in the neighborhood of the
present Gainesville. As we have seen, however, it is unsafe to trust
the estimates of distance. Arguing from the name, Meek infers that the
town was about Conasauga river in Murray county, and that the river
down which they marched to reach it was &ldquo;no doubt the
Etowah,&rdquo; although to reach the first named river from the Etowah
it would be necessary to make another sharp turn to the north. From the
same coincidence Pickett puts it on the Conasauga, &ldquo;in the modern
county of Murray, Georgia,&rdquo; while Jones, on the same theory,
locates it &ldquo;at or near the junction of the Connasauga and
Coosawattee rivers, in originally Cass, now Gordon county.&rdquo; Here
his modern geography as well as his ancient is at fault, as the
original Cass county is now Bartow, the name having been changed in
consequence of a local dislike for General Cass. The whole theory of a
march down the Coosa river rests upon this coincidence of the name. The
same name however, pronounced <i>G&#259;ns&acirc;&prime;g&#301;</i> by
the Cherokee, was applied by them to at least three different locations
within their old territory, while the one mentioned in the narrative
would make the fourth. The others were (1) on Oostanaula river,
opposite the mouth of the Conasauga, where afterward was New Echota, in
Gordon county, Georgia; (2) on Canasauga creek, in McMinn county,
Tennessee; (3) on Tuckasegee river, about two miles above Webster, in
Jackson county, North Carolina. At each of these places are remains of
ancient settlement. It is possible that the name of Kenesaw mountain,
near Marietta, in Cobb county, Georgia, may be a corruption of
<span class="corr" id="xd25e6973" title=
"Source: G&#259;ns&acirc;g&#301;">G&#259;ns&acirc;&prime;g&#301;</span>,
and if so, the Canasagua of the narrative may have been somewhere in
this vicinity on the Chattahoochee. The meaning of the name is
lost.</p>
<p>On leaving Canasagua they continued down the same river which they
had followed from Guaxule (Garcilaso), and after traveling several days
through an uninhabited (&ldquo;despoblado&rdquo;) country (Elvas)
arrived at Chiaha, which was subject to the great chief of Co&ccedil;a
(Elvas). The name is spelled Chiaha by Ranjel and the Gentleman
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>of Elvas, Chiha by Biedma in the Documentos,
China by a misprint in an English rendering, and Ychiaha by Garcilaso.
It appears as Chiha on an English map of 1762 reproduced in Winsor,
Westward Movement, page 31, 1897. Gallatin spells it Ichiaha, while
Williams and Fairbanks, by misprint, make it Chiapa. According to both
Ranjel and Elvas the army entered it on the 5th of June, although the
former makes it four days from Canasagua, while the other makes it
five. Biedma says it was four days from Guaxule, and, finally,
Garcilaso says it was six days and thirty leagues from Guaxule and on
the same river, which was, here at Chiaha, as large as the Guadalquivir
at Sevilla. As we have seen, there is a great discrepancy in the
statements of the distance from Cofitachiqui to this point. All four
authorities agree that the town was on an island in the river, along
which they had been marching for some time (Garcilaso, Ranjel), but
while the Elvas narrative makes the island &ldquo;two crossbow
shot&rdquo; in length above the town and one league in length below it,
Garcilaso calls it a &ldquo;great island more than five leagues
long.&rdquo; On both sides of the island the stream was very broad and
easily waded (Elvas). Finding welcome and food for men and horses the
Spaniards rested here nearly a month (June 5&ndash;28, Ranjel;
twenty-six or twenty-seven days, Biedma; thirty days, Elvas). In spite
of the danger from attack De Soto allowed his men to sleep under trees
in the open air, &ldquo;because it was very hot and the people should
have suffered great extremity if it had not been so&rdquo; (Elvas).
This in itself is evidence that the place was pretty far to the south,
as it was yet only the first week in June. The town was subject to the
chief of the great province of Co&ccedil;a, farther to the west. From
here onward they began to meet palisaded towns.</p>
<p>On the theory that the march was down Coosa river, every commentator
hitherto has located Chiaha at some point upon this stream, either in
Alabama or Georgia. Gallatin (1836) says that it &ldquo;must have been
on the Coosa, probably some distance below the site of New
Echota.&rdquo; He notes a similarity of sound between Ichiaha and
&ldquo;Echoy&rdquo; (Itsey&#301;), a Cherokee town name. Williams
(1837) says that it was on Mobile (i. e., the Alabama or lower Coosa
river). Meek (1839) says &ldquo;there can be little doubt that Chiaha
was situated but a short distance above the junction of the Coosa and
Chattooga rivers,&rdquo; i. e., not far within the Alabama line. He
notes the occurrence of a &ldquo;Chiaha&rdquo; (Chehawhaw) creek near
Talladega, Alabama. In regard to the island upon which the town was
said to have been situated he says: &ldquo;There is no such island now
in the Coosa. It is probable that the Spaniards either mistook the
peninsula formed by the junction of two rivers, the Coosa and
Chattooga, for an island, or that those two rivers were originally
united so as to form an island near their present confluence. We have
heard this latter supposition asserted by persons well acquainted with
the country.&rdquo;&mdash;Romantic Passages, p. 222, 1857. Monette
(1846) puts it on Etowah branch of the Coosa, probably in Floyd county,
Georgia. Pickett (1851), followed in turn by Irving, Jones, and Shea,
locates it at &ldquo;the site of the modern Rome.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;island&rdquo; is interpreted to mean the space between the two
streams above the confluence.</p>
<p>Pickett, as has been stated, bases his statements chiefly or
entirely upon Indian traditions as obtained from half breeds or
traders. How much information can be gathered from such sources in
regard to events that transpired three centuries before may be
estimated by considering how much an illiterate mountaineer of the same
region might be able to tell concerning the founding of the Georgia
colony. Pickett himself seems to have been entirely unaware of the
later Spanish expeditions of Pardo and De Luna through the same
country, as he makes no mention of them in his history of Alabama, but
ascribes everything to De Soto. Concerning Chiaha he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most ancient Cherokee Indians, whose tradition has been
handed down to us through old Indian traders, disagree as to the
precise place [!] where De Soto crossed the Oostanaula to get over into
the town of Chiaha&mdash;some asserting that he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>passed over that river seven miles above its
junction with the Etowah, and that he marched from thence down to
Chiaha, which, all contend, lay immediately at the confluence of the
two rivers; while other ancient Indians asserted that he crossed, with
his army, immediately opposite the town. But this is not very
important. Coupling the Indian traditions with the account by
Garcellasso and that by the Portuguese eyewitness, we are inclined to
believe the latter tradition that the expedition continued to advance
down the western side of the Oostanaula until they halted in view of
the mouth of the Etowah. De Soto, having arrived immediately opposite
the great town of Chiaha, now the site of Rome, crossed the
Oostanaula,&rdquo; etc. (History of Alabama, p. 23, reprint, 1896). He
overlooks the fact that Chiaha was not a Cherokee town, but belonged to
the province of Co&ccedil;a&mdash;i. e., the territory of the Creek
Indians.</p>
<p>A careful study of the four original narratives makes it plain that
the expedition did not descend either the Oostanaula or the Etowah, and
that consequently Chiaha could not have been at their junction, the
present site of Rome. On the other hand the conclusion is irresistible
that the march was down the Chattahoochee from its extreme head springs
in the mountains, and that the Chiaha of the narrative was the Lower
Creek town of the same name, more commonly known as Chehaw, formerly on
this river in the neighborhood of the modern city of Columbus, Georgia,
while Coste, in the narrative the next adjacent town, was Kasi&#699;ta,
or Cusseta, of the same group of villages. The falls at this point mark
the geologic break line where the river changes from a clear, swift
current to a broad, slow-moving stream of the lower country. Attracted
by the fisheries and the fertile bottom lands the Lower Creeks
established here their settlement nucleus, and here, up to the
beginning of the present century, they had within easy distance of each
other on both sides of the river some fifteen towns, among which were
Chiaha (Chehaw), Chiahudshi (Little Chehaw), and Kasi&#699;ta
(Cusseta). Most of these settlements were within what are now Muscogee
and Chattahoochee counties, Georgia, and Lee and Russell counties,
Alabama (see town list and map in Gatschet, Creek Migration Legend).
Large mounds and other earthworks on both sides of the river in the
vicinity of Columbus attest the importance of the site in ancient days,
while the general appearance indicates that at times the adjacent low
grounds were submerged or cut off by overflows from the main stream. A
principal trail crossed here from the Ocmulgee, passing by Tuskegee to
the Upper Creek towns about the junction of the Coosa and Tallapoosa in
Alabama. At the beginning of the present century this trail was known
to the traders as &ldquo;De Soto&rsquo;s trace&rdquo; (Woodward,
Reminiscences, p. 76). As the Indian towns frequently shift their
position within a limited range on account of epidemics, freshets, or
impoverishment of the soil, it is not necessary to assume that they
occupied exactly the same sites in 1540 as in 1800, but only that as a
group they were in the same general vicinity. Thus Kasi&#699;ta itself
was at one period above the falls and at a later period some eight
miles below them. Both Kasi&#699;ta and Chiaha were principal towns,
with several branch villages.</p>
<p>The time given as occupied on the march from Canasagua to Chiaha
would seem too little for the actual distance, but as we have seen, the
chroniclers do not agree among themselves. We can easily believe that
the Spaniards, buoyed up by the certainty of finding food and rest at
their next halting place, made better progress along the smooth river
trail than while blundering helplessly through the mountains at the
direction of a most unwilling guide. If Canasagua was anywhere in the
neighborhood of Kenesaw, in Cobb county, the time mentioned in the
Elvas or Garcilaso narrative would probably have been sufficient for
reaching Chiaha at the falls. The uninhabited country between the two
towns was the neutral ground between the two hostile tribes, the
Cherokee and the Creeks, and it is worth noting that Kenesaw mountain
was made a point on the boundary line afterward established between the
two tribes through the mediation of the United States government.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is no large island in either the Coosa or the Chattahoochee,
and we are forced to the conclusion that what the chronicle describes
as an island was really a portion of the bottom land temporarily cut
off by back water from a freshet. In a similar way &ldquo;The
Slue,&rdquo; east of Flint river in Mitchell county, may have been
formed by a shifting of the river channel. Two months later, in
Alabama, the Spaniards reached a river so swollen by rains that they
were obliged to wait six days before they could cross (Elvas). Lederer,
while crossing South Carolina in 1670, found his farther progress
barred by a &ldquo;great lake,&rdquo; which he puts on his map as
&ldquo;Ushery lake,&rdquo; although there is no such lake in the state;
but the mystery is explained by Lawson, who, in going over the same
ground thirty years later, found all the bottom lands under water from
a great flood, the Santee in particular being 36 feet above its normal
level. As Lawson was a surveyor his figures may be considered reliable.
The &ldquo;Ushery lake&rdquo; of Lederer was simply an overflow of
Catawba river. Flood water in the streams of upper Georgia and Alabama
would quickly be carried off, but would be apt to remain for some time
on the more level country below the falls.</p>
<p>According to information supplied by Mr Thomas Robinson, an expert
engineering authority familiar with the lower Chattahoochee, there was
formerly a large mound, now almost entirely washed away, on the eastern
bank of the river, about nine miles below Columbus, while on the
western or Alabama bank, a mile or two farther down, there is still to
be seen another of nearly equal size. &ldquo;At extreme freshets both
of these mounds were partly submerged. To the east of the former, known
as the Indian mound, the flood plain is a mile or two wide, and along
the eastern side of the plain stretches a series of swamps or wooded
sloughs, indicating an old river bed. All the plain between the present
river and the sloughs is river-made land. The river bluff along by the
mound on the Georgia side is from twenty to thirty feet above the
present low-water surface of the stream. About a mile above the mound
are the remains of what was known as Jennies island. At ordinary stages
of the river no island is there. The eastern channel was blocked by
government works some years ago, and the whole is filled up and now
used as a cornfield. The island remains can be traced now, I think, for
a length of half a mile, with a possible extreme width of 300
feet&#8202;&hellip;. This whole country, on both sides of the river, is
full of Indian lore. I have mentioned both mounds simply to indicate
that this portion of the river was an Indian locality, and have also
stated the facts about the remains of Jennies island in order to give a
possible clew to a professional who might study the
ground.&rdquo;&mdash;Letter, April 22, 1900.</p>
<p>Chiaha was the first town of the &ldquo;province of
Co&ccedil;a,&rdquo; the territory of the Coosa or Creek Indians. The
next town mentioned, Coste (Elvas and Ranjel), Costehe (Biedma) or
Acoste (Garcilaso), was Kasi&#699;ta, or Cusseta, as it was afterward
known to the whites. While Garcilaso puts it at the lower end of the
same island upon which Chiaha was situated, the Elvas narrative makes
it seven days distant! The modern towns of Chehaw and Cusseta were
within a few miles of each other on the Chattahoochee, the former being
on the western or Alabama side, while Cusseta, in 1799, was on the east
or Georgia side about eight miles below the falls at Columbus, and in
Chattahoochee county, which has given its capital the same name,
Cusseta. From the general tone of the narrative it is evident that the
two towns were near together in De Soto&rsquo;s time, and it may be
that the Elvas chronicle confounded Kasi&#699;ta with Koasati, a
principal Upper Creek town, a short distance below the junction of the
Coosa and Tallapoosa. At Coste they crossed the river and continued
westward &ldquo;through many towns subject to the cacique of
Co&ccedil;a&rdquo; (Elvas) until they came to the great town of
Co&ccedil;a itself. This was Kusa or Coosa, the ancient capital of the
Upper Creeks. There were two towns of this name at different periods.
One, described by Adair in 1775 as &ldquo;the great and old beloved
town of refuge, Koosah,&rdquo; was on the east bank of Coosa river, a
few miles southwest of the present Talladega, Alabama. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>other, known as &ldquo;Old Coosa,&rdquo; and
probably of more ancient origin, was on the west side of Alabama river,
near the present site of Montgomery (see Gatschet, Creek Migration
Legend). It was probably the latter which was visited by De Soto, and
later on by De Luna, in 1559. Beyond Coca they passed through another
Creek town, apparently lower down on the Alabama, the name of which is
variously spelled Ytaua (Elvas, Force translation), Ytava (Elvas,
Hakluyt Society translation), or Itaba (Ranjel), and which may be
connected with I&prime;t&#259;w&#259;&prime;, Etowah or
&ldquo;Hightower,&rdquo; the name of a former Cherokee settlement near
the head of Etowah river in Georgia. The Cherokee regard this as a
foreign name, and its occurrence in upper Georgia, as well as in
central Alabama, may help to support the tradition that the southern
Cherokee border was formerly held by the Creeks.</p>
<p>De Soto&rsquo;s route beyond the Cherokee country does not concern
us except as it throws light upon his previous progress. In the
seventeenth chapter the Elvas narrative summarizes that portion from
the landing at Tampa bay to a point in southern Alabama as follows:
&ldquo;From the Port de Spirito Santo to Apalache, which is about an
hundred leagues, the governor went from east to west; and from Apalache
to Cutifachiqui, which are 430 leagues, from the southwest to the
northeast; and from Cutifachiqui to Xualla, which are about 250
leagues, from the south to the north; and from Xualla to Tascaluca,
which are 250 leagues more, an hundred and ninety of them he traveled
from east to west, to wit, to the province of Co&ccedil;a; and the
other 60, from Co&ccedil;a to Tascaluca, from the north to the
south.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chisca (Elvas and Ranjel), the mountainous northern region in search
of which men were sent from Chiaha to look for copper and gold, was
somewhere in the Cherokee country of upper Georgia or Alabama. The
precise location is not material, as it is now known that native
copper, in such condition as to have been easily workable by the
Indians, occurs throughout the whole southern Allegheny region from
about Anniston, Alabama, into Virginia. Notable finds of native copper
have been made on the upper Tallapoosa, in Cleburne county, Alabama;
about Ducktown, in Polk county, Tennessee, and in southwestern
Virginia, one nugget from Virginia weighing several pounds. From the
appearance of ancient soapstone vessels which have been found in the
same region there is even a possibility that the Indians had some
knowledge of smelting, as the Spanish explorers surmised (oral
information from Mr W. H. Weed, U. S. Geological Survey). We hear again
of this &ldquo;province&rdquo; after De Soto had reached the
Mississippi, and in one place Garcilaso seems to confound it with
another province called Quizqui (Ranjel) or Quizquiz (Elvas and
Biedma). The name has some resemblance to the Cherokee word
<i>tsiskwa</i>, &ldquo;bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(9) <span class="sc">De Luna and Rogel</span> (p. <a href="#pb27"
class="pageref">27</a>): Jones, in his De Soto&rsquo;s March through
Georgia, incorrectly ascribes certain traces of ancient mining
operations in the Cherokee country, particularly on Valley river in
North Carolina, to the followers of De Luna, &ldquo;who, in 1560
&hellip; came with 300 Spanish soldiers into this region, and spent the
summer in eager and laborious search for gold.&rdquo; Don Tristan de
Luna, with fifteen hundred men, landed somewhere about Mobile bay in
1559 with the design of establishing a permanent Spanish settlement in
the interior, but owing to a succession of unfortunate happenings the
attempt was abandoned the next year. In the course of his wanderings he
traversed the country of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Upper Creeks, as
is shown by the names and other data in the narrative, but returned
without entering the mountains or doing any digging (see Barcia, Ensayo
Cronologico, pp. 32&ndash;41, 1723; Winsor, Narrative and Critical
History, <span class="sc">II</span>, pp. 257&ndash;259).</p>
<p>In 1569 the Jesuit Rogel&mdash;called Father John Roger by
Shea&mdash;began mission work among the South Carolina tribes inland
from Santa Elena (about Port Royal). The mission, which at first
promised well, was abandoned next year, owing to the unwillingness of
the Indians to give up their old habits and beliefs. Shea, in his
&ldquo;Catholic Missions,&rdquo; supposes that these Indians were
probably a part of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href=
"#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>Cherokee, but a study of the
Spanish record in Barcia (Ensayo, pp. 138&ndash;141) shows that Rogel
penetrated only a short distance from the coast.</p>
<p>(10) <span class="sc">Davies&rsquo; History of the Carribby
Islands</span> (p. <a href="#pb29" class="pageref">29</a>): The
fraudulent character of this work, which is itself an altered
translation of a fictitious history by Rochefort, is noted by
Buckingham Smith (Letter of Hernando de Soto, p. 36, 1854), Winsor
(Narrative and Critical History, <span class="sc">II</span>, p. 289),
and Field (Indian Bibliography, p. 95). Says Field: &ldquo;This book is
an example of the most unblushing effrontery. The pseudo author assumes
the credit of the performance, with but the faintest allusion to its
previous existence. It is a nearly faithful translation of
Rochefort&rsquo;s &lsquo;<span lang="fr">Histoire des

Davies&rsquo; treatment of Rochefort, for the work of the latter was
fictitious in every part which was not purloined from authors whose
knowledge furnished him with all in his treatise which was
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(11) <span class="sc">Ancient Spanish Mines</span> (pp. 29, 31): As
the existence of the precious metals in the southern Alleghenies was
known to the Spaniards from a very early period, it is probable that
more thorough exploration of that region will bring to light many
evidences of their mining operations. In his &ldquo;Antiquities of the
Southern Indians,&rdquo; Jones describes a sort of subterranean village
discovered in 1834 on Dukes creek, White county, Georgia, consisting of
a row of small log cabins extending along the creek, but imbedded
several feet below the surface of the ground, upon which large trees
were growing, the inference being that the houses had been thus covered
by successive freshets. The logs had been notched and shaped apparently
with sharp metallic tools. Shafts have been discovered on &ldquo;Valley
river, North Carolina, at the bottom of one of which was found, in
1854, a well-preserved windlass of hewn oak timbers, showing traces of
having once been banded with iron. Another shaft, passing through hard
rock, showed the marks of sharp tools used in the boring. The casing
and other timbers were still sound (Jones, pp. 48, 49). Similar ancient
shafts have been found in other places in upper Georgia and western
North Carolina, together with some remarkable stone-built
fortifications or corrals, notably at Fort mountain, in Murray county,
Georgia, and on Silver creek, a few miles from Rome, Georgia.</p>
<p>Very recently remains of an early white settlement, traditionally
ascribed to the Spaniards, have been reported from Lincolnton, North
Carolina, on the edge of the ancient country of the Sara, among whom
the Spaniards built a fort in 1566. The works include a dam of cut
stone, a series of low pillars of cut stone, arranged in squares as
though intended for foundations, a stone-walled well, a quarry from
which the stone had been procured, a fire pit, and a series of sinks,
extending along the stream, in which were found remains of timbers
suggesting the subterranean cabins on Dukes creek. All these antedated
the first settlement of that region, about the year 1750. Ancient
mining indications are also reported from Kings mountain, about twenty
miles distant (Reinhardt MS, 1900, in Bureau of American Ethnology
archives). The Spanish miners of whom Lederer heard in 1670 and Moore
in 1690 were probably at work in this neighborhood.</p>
<p>(12) <span class="sc">Sir William Johnson</span> (p. <a href="#pb38"
class="pageref">38</a>): This great soldier, whose history is so
inseparably connected with that of the Six Nations, was born in the
county Meath, Ireland, in 1715, and died at Johnstown, New York, in
1774. The younger son of an Irish gentleman, he left his native country
in 1738 in consequence of a disappointment in love, and emigrated to
America, where he undertook the settlement of a large tract of wild
land belonging to his uncle, which lay along the south side of the
Mohawk river in what was then the wilderness of New York. This brought
him into close contact with the Six Nations, particularly the Mohawks,
in whom he became so much interested as to learn their language and in
some degree to accommodate himself to their customs, sometimes even to
the wearing of the native costume. This interest, together with his
natural kindness and dignity, completely won the hearts of the Six
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>Nations, over whom he acquired a greater
influence than has ever been exercised by any other white man before or
since. He was formally adopted as a chief by the Mohawk tribe. In 1744,
being still a very young man, he was placed in charge of British
affairs with the Six Nations, and in 1755 was regularly commissioned at
their own urgent request as superintendent for the Six Nations and
their dependent and allied tribes, a position which he held for the
rest of his life. In 1748 he was also placed in command of the New York
colonial forces, and two years later was appointed to the
governor&rsquo;s council. At the beginning of the French and Indian war
he was commissioned a major-general. He defeated Dieskau at the battle
of Lake George, where he was severely wounded early in the action, but
refused to leave the field. For this service he received the thanks of
Parliament, a grant of &pound;5,000, and a baronetcy. He also
distinguished himself at Ticonderoga and Fort Niagara, taking the
latter after routing the French army sent to its relief. At the head of
his Indian and colonial forces he took part in other actions and
expeditions, and was present at the surrender of Montreal. For his
services throughout the war he received a grant of 100,000 acres of
land north of the Mohawk river. Here he built &ldquo;Johnson
Hall,&rdquo; which still stands, near the village of Johnstown, which
was laid out by him with stores, church, and other buildings, at his
own expense. At Johnson Hall he lived in the style of an old country
baron, dividing his attention between Indian affairs and the raising of
blooded stock, and dispensing a princely hospitality to all comers. His
influence alone prevented the Six Nations joining Pontiac&rsquo;s great
confederacy against the English. In 1768 he concluded the treaty of
Fort Stanwix, which fixed the Ohio as the boundary between the northern
colonies and the western tribes, the boundary for which the Indians
afterward contended against the Americans until 1795. In 1739 he
married a German girl of the Mohawk valley, who died after bearing him
three children. Later in life he formed a connection with the sister of
Brant, the Mohawk chief. He died from over-exertion at an Indian
council. His son, Sir John Johnson, succeeded to his title and estates,
and on the breaking out of the Revolution espoused the British side,
drawing with him the Mohawks and a great part of the other Six Nations,
who abandoned their homes and fled with him to Canada (see W. L. Stone,
Life of Sir William Johnson).</p>
<p>(13) <span class="sc">Captain John Stuart</span> (p. <a href="#pb44"
class="pageref">44</a>): This distinguished officer was contemporaneous
with Sir William Johnson, and sprang from the same adventurous Keltic
stock which has furnished so many men conspicuous in our early Indian
history. Born in Scotland about the year 1700, he came to America in
1733, was appointed to a subordinate command in the British service,
and soon became a favorite with the Indians. When Fort Loudon was taken
by the Cherokee in 1760, he was second in command, and his rescue by
Ata-kullakulla is one of the romantic episodes of that period. In 1763
he was appointed superintendent for the southern tribes, a position
which he continued to hold until his death. In 1768 he negotiated with
the Cherokee the treaty of Hard Labor by which the Kanawha was fixed as
the western boundary of Virginia, Sir William Johnson at the same time
concluding a treaty with the northern tribes by which the boundary was
continued northward along the Ohio. At the outbreak of the Revolution
he organized the Cherokee and other southern tribes, with the white
loyalists, against the Americans, and was largely responsible for the
Indian outrages along the southern border. He planned a general
invasion by the southern tribes along the whole frontier, in
cooperation with a British force to be landed in western Florida, while
a British fleet should occupy the attention of the Americans on the
coast side and the Tories should rise in the interior. On the discovery
of the plot and the subsequent defeat of the Cherokee by the Americans,
he fled to Florida and soon afterward sailed for England, where he died

"pageref">47</a>): A noted halfbreed Cherokee woman, the date and place
of whose birth and death are alike unknown. It is said that her father
was a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>British officer named Ward and her mother a
sister of Ata-kullakulla, principal chief of the Nation at the time of
the first Cherokee war. She was probably related to Brian Ward, an
oldtime trader among the Cherokee, mentioned elsewhere in connection
with the battle of Tali&prime;w&#259;. During the Revolutionary period
she resided at Echota, the national capital, where she held the office
of &ldquo;Beloved Woman,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pretty Woman,&rdquo; by
virtue of which she was entitled to speak in councils and to decide the
fate of captives. She distinguished herself by her constant friendship
for the Americans, always using her best effort to bring about peace
between them and her own people, and frequently giving timely warning
of projected Indian raids, notably on the occasion of the great
invasion of the Watauga and Holston settlements in 1776. A Mrs Bean,
captured during this incursion, was saved by her interposition after
having been condemned to death and already bound to the stake. In 1780,
on occasion of another Cherokee outbreak, she assisted a number of
traders to escape, and the next year was sent by the chiefs to make
peace with Sevier and Campbell, who were advancing against the Cherokee
towns. Campbell speaks of her in his report as &ldquo;the famous Indian
woman, Nancy Ward.&rdquo; Although peace was not then granted, her
relatives, when brought in later with other prisoners, were treated
with the consideration due in return for her good offices. She is
described by Robertson, who visited her about this time, as
&ldquo;queenly and commanding&rdquo; in appearance and manner, and her
house as furnished in accordance with her high dignity. When among the
Arkansas Cherokee in 1819, Nuttall was told that she had introduced the
first cows into the Nation, and that by her own and her
children&rsquo;s influence the condition of the Cherokee had been
greatly elevated. He was told also that her advice and counsel bordered
on supreme, and that her interference was allowed to be decisive even
in affairs of life and death. Although he speaks in the present tense,
it is hardly probable that she was then still alive, and he does not
claim to have met her. Her descendants are still found in the Nation.

<p>(15) <span class="sc">General James Robertson</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb48" class="pageref">48</a>): This distinguished pioneer and founder
of Nashville was born in Brunswick county, Virginia, in 1742, and died
at the Chickasaw agency in west Tennessee in 1814. Like most of the men
prominent in the early history of Tennessee, he was of Scotch-Irish
ancestry. His father having removed about 1750 to western North
Carolina, the boy grew up without education, but with a strong love for
adventure, which he gratified by making exploring expeditions across
the mountains. After his marriage his wife taught him to read and
write. In 1771 he led a colony to the Watauga river and established the
settlement which became the nucleus of the future state of Tennessee.
He took a leading part in the organization of the Watauga Association,
the earliest organized government within the state, and afterward
served in Dunmore&rsquo;s war, taking part in the bloody battle of
Point Pleasant in 1774. He participated in the earlier Revolutionary
campaigns against the Cherokee, and in 1777 was appointed agent to
reside at their capital, Echota, and act as a medium in their
correspondence with the state governments of North Carolina (including
Tennessee) and Virginia. In this capacity he gave timely warning of a
contemplated invasion by the hostile portion of the tribe early in
1779. Soon after in the same year he led a preliminary exploration from
Watauga to the Cumberland. He brought out a larger party late in the
fall, and in the spring of 1780 built the first stockades on the site
which he named Nashborough, now Nashville. Only his force of character
was able to hold the infant settlement together in the face of
hardships and Indian hostilities, but by his tact and firmness he was
finally able to make peace with the surrounding tribes, and established
the Cumberland settlement upon a secure basis. The Spanish government
at one time unsuccessfully attempted to engage him in a plot to cut off
the western territory from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205"
href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>United States, but met a
patriotic refusal. Having been commissioned a brigadier-general in
1790, he continued to organize campaigns, resist invasions, and
negotiate treaties until the final close of the Indian wars in
Tennessee. He afterward held the appointment of Indian commissioner to
the Chickasaw and Choctaw. See Ramsey, Tennessee; Roosevelt, Winning of
the West; Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia of American Biography.</p>
<p>(16) <span class="sc">General Griffith Rutherford</span> (p.
<a href="#pb48" class="pageref">48</a>): Although this Revolutionary
officer commanded the greatest expedition ever sent against the
Cherokee, with such distinguished success that both North Carolina and
Tennessee have named counties in his honor, little appears to be
definitely known of his history. He was born in Ireland about 1731,
and, emigrating to America, settled near Salisbury, North Carolina. On
the opening of the Revolutionary struggle he became a member of the
Provincial Congress and Council of Safety. In June, 1776, he was
commissioned a brigadier-general in the American army, and a few months
later led his celebrated expedition against the Cherokee, as elsewhere
narrated. He rendered other important service in the Revolution, in one
battle being taken prisoner by the British and held by them nearly a
year. He afterward served in the state senate of North Carolina, and,
subsequently removing to Tennessee, was for some time a member of its
territorial council. He died in Tennessee about 1800.</p>
<p>(17) <span class="sc">Rutherford&rsquo;s route</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb49" class="pageref">49</a>): The various North Carolina detachments
which combined to form Rutherford&rsquo;s expedition against the
Cherokee in the autumn of 1776 organized at different points about the
upper Catawba and probably concentrated at Davidson&rsquo;s fort, now
Old fort, in McDowell county. Thence, advancing westward closely upon
the line of the present Southern railroad and its Western North
Carolina branch, the army crossed the Blue ridge over the Swannanoa gap
and went down the Swannanoa to its junction with the French Broad,
crossing the latter at the Warrior ford, below the present Asheville;
thence up Hominy creek and across the ridge to Pigeon river, crossing
it a few miles below the junction of the East and West forks; thence to
Richland creek, crossing it just above the present Waynesville; and
over the dividing ridge between the present Haywood and Jackson
counties to the head of Scott&rsquo;s creek; thence down that creek by
&ldquo;a blind path through a very mountainous bad way,&rdquo; as
Moore&rsquo;s old narrative has it, to its junction with the Tuckasegee
river just below the present Webster; thence, crossing to the west
(south) side of the river, the troops followed a main trail down the
stream for a few miles until they came to the first Cherokee town,
Stekoa, on the site of the farm formerly owned by Colonel William H.
Thomas, just above the present railroad village of Whittier, Swain
county, North Carolina. After destroying the town a detachment left the
main body and pursued the fugitives northward on the other side of the
river to Oconaluftee river and Soco creek, getting back afterward to
the settlements by steering an easterly course across the mountains to
Richland creek (Moore narrative). The main army, under Rutherford,
crossed the dividing ridge to the southward of Whittier and descended
Cowee creek to the waters of Little Tennessee, in the present Macon
county. After destroying the towns in this vicinity the army ascended
Cartoogaja creek, west from the present Franklin, and crossed the
Nantahala mountains at Waya gap&mdash;where a fight took place&mdash;to
Nantahala river, probably at the town of the same name, about the
present Jarretts station. From here the march was west across the
mountain into the present Cherokee county and down Valley river to its
junction with the Hiwassee, at the present Murphy. <i>Authorities</i>:

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=

county, Virginia, in 1732. Accustomed to frontier warfare almost from
boyhood, he served in the French and Indian war with the rank of
captain, and was afterward in command of the Tennessee and North
Carolina forces which participated in the great battle of Point
Pleasant in 1774, although he himself arrived too late for the fight.
He organized a regiment at the opening of the Revolutionary war, and in
1776 led an expedition from Virginia against the Upper Cherokee and
compelled them to sue for peace. In 1782, while upon an expedition
against the Ohio tribes, he was captured and burned at the stake.</p>
<p id="hn19">(19) <span class="sc">The great Indian war path</span> (p.
<a href="#pb50" class="pageref">50</a>): This noted Indian thoroughfare
from Virginia through Kentucky and Tennessee to the Creek country in
Alabama and Georgia is frequently mentioned in the early narrative of
that section, and is indicated on the maps accompanying Ramsey&rsquo;s
Annals of Tennessee and Royce&rsquo;s Cherokee Nation, in the Fifth
Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology. Royce&rsquo;s map shows it in
more correct detail. It was the great trading and war path between the
northern and southern tribes, and along the same path Christian,
Sevier, and others of the old Indian fighters led their men to the
destruction of the towns on Little Tennessee, Hiwassee, and
southward.</p>
<p>According to Ramsey (p. <a href="#pb88" class="pageref">88</a>), one
branch of it ran nearly on the line of the later stage road from
Harpers ferry to Knoxville, passing the Big lick in Botetourt county,
Virginia, crossing New river near old Fort Chiswell (which stood on the
south bank of Reed creek of New river, about nine miles east from
Wytheville, Virginia) crossing Holston at the Seven-mile ford, thence
to the left of the stage road near the river to the north fork of
Holston, &ldquo;crossing as at present&rdquo;; thence to Big creek,
and, crossing the Holston at Dodson&rsquo;s ford, to the Grassy springs
near the former residence of Micajah Lea; thence down the Nolichucky to
Long creek, up it to its head, and down Dumplin creek nearly to its
mouth, where the path bent to the left and crossed French Broad near
Buckinghams island. Here a branch left it and went up the West fork of
Little Pigeon and across the mountains to the Middle towns on
Tuckasegee and the upper Little Tennessee. The main trail continued up
Boyd&rsquo;s creek to its head, and down Ellejoy creek to Little river,
crossing near Henry&rsquo;s place; thence by the present Maryville to
the mouth of Tellico, and, passing through the Cherokee towns of
Tellico, Echota, and Hiwassee, down the Coosa, connecting with the
great war path of the Creeks. Near the Wolf hills, now Abingdon,
Virginia, another path came in from Kentucky, passing through the
Cumberland gap. It was along this latter road that the early explorers
entered Kentucky, and along it also the Shawano and other Ohio tribes
often penetrated to raid upon the Holston and New river
settlements.</p>
<p>On Royce&rsquo;s map the trail is indicated from Virginia southward.
Starting from the junction of Moccasin creek with the North fork of
Holston, just above the Tennessee state line, it crosses the latter
river from the east side at its mouth or junction with the South fork,
just below Kingsport or the Long island; then follows down along the
west side of the Holston, crossing Big creek at its mouth, and crossing
to the south (east) side of Holston at Dodson&rsquo;s creek; thence up
along the east side of Dodson&rsquo;s creek and across Big Gap creek,
following it for a short distance and continuing southwest, just
touching Nolichucky, passing up the west side of Long creek of that
stream and down the same side of Dumplin creek, and crossing French
Broad just below the mouth of the creek; thence up along the west side
of Boyd&rsquo;s creek to its head and down the west side of Ellejoy
creek to and across Little river; thence through the present Maryville
to cross Little Tennessee at the entrance of Tellico river, where old
Fort Loudon was built; thence turning up along the south side of Little
Tennessee river to Echota, the ancient capital, and then southwest
across Tellico river along the ridge between Chestua and Canasauga
creeks, and crossing the latter near its mouth to strike Hiwassee river
at the town of the same name; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207"
href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>thence southwest, crossing
Ocoee river near its mouth, passing south of Cleveland, through the
present Ooltewah and across Chickamauga creek into Georgia and
Alabama.</p>
<p>According to Timberlake (Memoirs, with map, 1765), the trail crossed
Little Tennessee from Echota, northward, in two places, just above and
below Four-mile creek, the first camping place being at the junction of
Ellejoy creek and Little river, at the old town site. It crossed
Holston within a mile of Fort Robinson.</p>
<p>According to Hutching (Topographical Description of America, p. 24,
1778), the road which went through Cumberland gap was the one taken by
the northern Indians in their incursions into the &ldquo;Cuttawa&rdquo;
country, and went from Sandusky, on Lake Erie, by a direct path to the
mouth of Scioto (where Portsmouth now is) and thence across Kentucky to
the gap.</p>
<p>(20) <span class="sc">Peace towns and towns of refuge</span> (p.
<a href="#pb51" class="pageref">51</a>): Towns of refuge existed among
the Cherokee, the Creeks, and probably other Indian tribes, as well as
among the ancient Hebrews, the institution being a merciful provision
for softening the harshness of the primitive law, which required a life
for a life. We learn from Deuteronomy that Moses appointed three cities
on the east side of Jordan &ldquo;that the slayer might flee thither
which should kill his neighbor unawares and hated him not in times
past, and that fleeing into one of these cities he might live.&rdquo;
It was also ordained that as more territory was conquered from the
heathen three additional cities should be thus set aside as havens of
refuge for those who should accidentally take human life, and where
they should be safe until the matter could be adjusted. The wilful
murderer, however, was not to be sheltered, but delivered up to
punishment without pity (Deut. <span class="sc">IV</span>, 41&ndash;43,
and <span class="sc">XIX</span>, 1&ndash;11).</p>
<p>Echota, the ancient Cherokee capital near the mouth of Little
Tennessee, was the Cherokee town of refuge, commonly designated as the
&ldquo;white town&rdquo; or &ldquo;peace town.&rdquo; According to
Adair, the Cherokee in his time, although extremely degenerate in other
things, still observed the law so strictly in this regard that even a
wilful murderer who might succeed in making his escape to that town was
safe so long as he remained there, although, unless the matter was
compounded in the meantime, the friends of the slain person would
seldom allow him to reach home alive after leaving it. He tells how a
trader who had killed an Indian to protect his own property took refuge
in Echota, and after having been there for some months prepared to
return to his trading store, which was but a short distance away, but
was assured by the chiefs that he would be killed if he ventured
outside the town. He was accordingly obliged to stay a longer time
until the tears of the bereaved relatives had been wiped away with
presents. In another place the same author tells how a Cherokee, having
killed a trader, was pursued and attempted to take refuge in the town,
but was driven off into the river as soon as he came in sight by the
inhabitants, who feared either to have their town polluted by the
shedding of blood or to provoke the English by giving him sanctuary
(Adair, American Indians, p. 158, 1775). In 1768 Oconostota, speaking
on behalf of the Cherokee delegates who had come to Johnson Hall to
make peace with the Iroquois, said: &ldquo;We come from Chotte, where
the wise [white?] house, the house of peace is erected&rdquo; (treaty
record, 1768, New York Colonial Documents, <span class=
"sc">VIII</span>, p. 42, 1857). In 1786 the friendly Cherokee made
&ldquo;Chota&rdquo; the watchword by which the Americans might be able
to distinguish them from the hostile Creeks (Ramsey, Tennessee, p.
343). From conversation with old Cherokee it seems probable that in
cases where no satisfaction was made by the relatives of the man-slayer
he continued to reside close within the limits of the town until the
next recurrence of the annual Green-corn dance, when a general amnesty
was proclaimed.</p>
<p>Among the Creeks the ancient town of Kusa or Coosa, on Coosa river
in Alabama, was a town of refuge. In Adair&rsquo;s time, although then
almost deserted and in ruins, it was still a place of safety for one
who had taken human life without design. Certain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>towns were also known as peace towns, from their
prominence in peace ceremonials and treaty making. Upon this Adair
says: &ldquo;In almost every Indian nation there are several
<i>peaceable towns</i>, which are called &lsquo;old beloved, ancient,
holy, or white towns.&rsquo; They seem to have been formerly towns of
refuge, for it is not in the memory of their oldest people that ever
human blood was shed in them, although they often force persons from
thence and put them to death elsewhere.&rdquo;&mdash;Adair, American
Indians, 159. A closely parallel institution seems to have existed
among the Seneca. &ldquo;The Seneca nation, ever the largest, and
guarding the western door of the &lsquo;long house,&rsquo; which was
threatened alike from the north, west, and south, had traditions
peculiarly their own, besides those common to the other members of the
confederacy. The stronghold or fort, Gau-stra-yea, on the mountain
ridge, four miles east of Lewiston, had a peculiar character as the
residence of a virgin queen known as the &lsquo;Peacemaker.&rsquo; When
the Iroquois confederacy was first formed the prime factors were mutual
protection and domestic peace, and this fort was designed to afford
comfort and relieve the distress incident to war. It was a true
&lsquo;city of refuge,&rsquo; to which fugitives from battle, whatever
their nationality, might flee for safety and find generous
entertainment. Curtains of deerskin separated pursuer and pursued while
they were being lodged and fed. At parting, the curtains were
withdrawn, and the hostile parties, having shared the hospitality of
the queen, could neither renew hostility or pursuit without the
queen&rsquo;s consent. According to tradition, no virgin had for many
generations been counted worthy to fill the place or possessed the
genius and gifts to honor the position. In 1878 the Tonawanda band
proposed to revive the office and conferred upon Caroline Parker the
title.&rdquo;&mdash;Carrington, in Six Nations of New York, Extra
Bulletin Eleventh Census, p. 73, 1892.</p>
<p>(21) <span class="sc">Scalping by whites</span> (p. <a href="#pb53"
class="pageref">53</a>): To the student, aware how easily the civilized
man reverts to his original savagery when brought in close contact with
its conditions, it will be no surprise to learn that every barbarous
practice of Indian warfare was quickly adopted by the white pioneer and
soldier and frequently legalized and encouraged by local authority.
Scalping, while the most common, was probably the least savage and
cruel of them all, being usually performed after the victim was already
dead, with the primary purpose of securing a trophy of the victory. The
tortures, mutilations, and nameless deviltries inflicted upon Indians
by their white conquerors in the early days could hardly be paralleled
even in civilized Europe, when burning at the stake was the punishment
for holding original opinions and sawing into two pieces the penalty
for desertion. Actual torture of Indians by legal sanction was rare
within the English colonies, but mutilation was common and scalping was
the rule down to the end of the war of 1812, and has been practiced
more or less in almost every Indian war down to the latest. Captain
Church, who commanded in King Philip&rsquo;s war in 1676, states that
his men received thirty shillings a head for every Indian killed or
taken, and Philip&rsquo;s head, after it was cut off, &ldquo;went at
the same price.&rdquo; When the chief was killed one of his hands was
cut off and given to his Indian slayer, &ldquo;to show to such
gentlemen as would bestow gratuities upon him, and accordingly he got
many a penny by it.&rdquo; His other hand was chopped off and sent to
Boston for exhibition, his head was sent to Plymouth and exposed upon a
scaffold there for twenty years, while the rest of his body was
quartered and the pieces left hanging upon four trees. Fifty years
later Massachusetts offered a bounty of one hundred pounds for every
Indian scalp, and scalp hunting thus became a regular and usually a
profitable business. On one occasion a certain Lovewell, having
recruited a company of forty men for this purpose, discovered ten
Indians lying asleep by their fire and killed the whole party. After
scalping them they stretched the scalps upon hoops and marched thus
into Boston, where the scalps were paraded and the bounty of one
thousand pounds paid for them. By a few other scalps sold from time to
time at the regular market rate, Lovewell was gradually acquiring a
competency when in May, 1725, his company <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>met disaster. He
discovered and shot a solitary hunter, who was afterward scalped by the
chaplain of the party, but the Indian managed to kill Lovewell before
being overpowered, on which the whites withdrew, but were pursued by
the tribesmen of the slain hunter, with the result that but sixteen of
them got home alive. A famous old ballad of the time tells how</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Our worthy Captain Lovewell among them there did
die.</p>
<p class="line">They killed Lieutenant Robbins and wounded good young
Frye,</p>
<p class="line">Who was our English chaplain; he many Indians slew,</p>
<p class="line">And some of them he scalped when bullets round him
flew.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When the mission village of Norridgewock was attacked
by the New England men about the same time, women and children were
made to suffer the fate of the warriors. The scholarly missionary,
Rasles, author of the Abnaki Dictionary, was shot down at the foot of
the cross, where he was afterward found with his body riddled with
balls, his skull crushed and scalped, his mouth and eyes filled with
earth, his limbs broken, and all his members mutilated&mdash;and this
by white men. The border men of the Revolutionary period and later
invariably scalped slain Indians as often as opportunity permitted,
and, as has already been shown, both British and American officials
encouraged the practice by offers of bounties and rewards, even, in the
case of the former, when the scalps were those of white people. Our
difficulties with the Apache date from a treacherous massacre of them
in 1836 by a party of American scalp hunters in the pay of the governor
of Sonora. The bounty offered was one ounce of gold per scalp. In 1864
the Colorado militia under Colonel Chivington attacked a party of
Cheyennes camped under the protection of the United States flag, and
killed, mutilated, and scalped 170 men, women, and children, bringing
the scalps into Denver, where they were paraded in a public hall. One
Lieutenant Richmond killed and scalped three women and five children.
Scalps were taken by American troops in the Modoc war of 1873, and
there is now living in the Comanche tribe a woman who was scalped,
though not mortally wounded, by white soldiers in one of the later
Indian encounters in Texas. <i>Authorities</i>: Drake, Indians (for New

<p>(22) <span class="sc">Lower Cherokee refugees</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb55" class="pageref">55</a>): &ldquo;In every hut I have visited I
find the children exceedingly alarmed at the sight of white men, and
here [at Willstown] a little boy of eight years old was excessively
alarmed and could not be kept from screaming out until he got out of
the door, and then he ran and hid himself; but as soon as I can
converse with them and they are informed who I am they execute any
order I give them with eagerness. I inquired particularly of the
mothers what could be the reason for this. They said, this town was the
remains of several towns who [<i>sic</i>] formerly resided on Tugalo
and Keowee, and had been much harassed by the whites; that the old
people remembered their former situation and suffering, and frequently
spoke of them; that these tales were listened to by the children, and
made an impression which showed itself in the manner I had observed.
The women told me, who I saw gathering nuts, that they had sensations
upon my coming to the camp, in the highest degree alarming to them, and
when I lit from my horse, took them by the hand, and spoke to them,
they at first could not reply, although one of them understood and
spoke English very well.&rdquo;&mdash;Hawkins, manuscript journal,
1796, in library of Georgia Historical Society.</p>
<p>(23) <span class="sc">General Alexander McGillivray</span> (p.
<a href="#pb56" class="pageref">56</a>): This famous Creek chieftain,
like so many distinguished men of the southern tribes, was of mixed
blood, being the son of a Scotch trader, Lachlan McGillivray, by a
halfbreed woman of influential family, whose father was a French
officer of Fort Toulouse. The future chief was born in the Creek Nation
about 1740, and died at Pensacola, Florida, in 1793. He <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>was
educated at Charleston, studying Latin in addition to the ordinary
branches, and after leaving school was placed by his father with a
mercantile firm in Savannah. He remained but a short time, when he
returned to the Creek country, where he soon began to attract
attention, becoming a partner in the firm of Panton, Forbes &amp;
Leslie, of Pensacola, which had almost a monopoly of the Creek trade.
He succeeded to the chieftainship on the death of his mother, who came
of ruling stock, but refused to accept the position until called to it
by a formal council, when he assumed the title of emperor of the Creek
Nation. His paternal estates having been confiscated by Georgia at the
outbreak of the Revolution, he joined the British side with all his
warriors, and continued to be a leading instigator in the border
hostilities until 1790, when he visited New York with a large retinue
and made a treaty of peace with the United States on behalf of his
people. President Washington&rsquo;s instructions to the treaty
commissioners, in anticipation of this visit, state that he was said to
possess great abilities and an unlimited influence over the Creeks and
part of the Cherokee, and that it was an object worthy of considerable
effort to attach him warmly to the United States. In pursuance of this
policy the Creek chiefs were entertained by the Tammany society, all
the members being in full Indian dress, at which the visitors were much
delighted and responded with an Indian dance, while McGillivray was
induced to resign his commission as colonel in the Spanish service for
a commission of higher grade in the service of the United States. Soon
afterward, on account of some opposition, excited by Bowles, a renegade
white man, he absented himself from his tribe for a time, but was soon
recalled, and continued to rule over the Nation until his death.</p>
<p>McGillivray appears to have had a curious mixture of Scotch
shrewdness, French love of display, and Indian secretiveness. He fixed
his residence at Little Talassee, on the Coosa, a few miles above the
present Wetumpka, Alabama, where he lived in a handsome house with
extensive quarters for his negro slaves, so that his place had the
appearance of a small town. He entertained with magnificence and
traveled always in state, as became one who styled himself emperor.
Throughout the Indian wars he strove, so far as possible, to prevent
unnecessary cruelties, being noted for his kindness to captives; and
his last years were spent in an effort to bring teachers among his
people. On the other hand, he conformed much to the Indian customs; and
he managed his negotiations with England, Spain, and the United States
with such adroitness that he was able to play off one against the
other, holding commissions by turn in the service of all three.
Woodward, who knew of him by later reputation, asserts positively that
McGillivray&rsquo;s mother was of pure Indian blood and that he himself
was without education, his letters having been written for him by
Leslie, of the trading firm with which he was connected. The balance of
testimony, however, seems to leave no doubt that he was an educated as
well as an able man, whatever may have been his origin.

1815. His father was a French immigrant of good birth and education,
the original name of the family being Xavier. The son received a good
education, and being naturally remarkably handsome and of polished
manner, fine courage, and generous temperament, soon acquired a
remarkable influence over the rough border men with whom his lot was
cast and among whom he was afterward affectionately known as
&ldquo;Chucky Jack.&rdquo; To the Cherokee he was known as
Tsan-usdi&prime;, &ldquo;Little John.&rdquo; After some service against
the Indians on the Virginia frontier he removed to the new Watauga
settlement in Tennessee, in 1772, and at once became prominently
identified with its affairs. He took <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>part in
Dunmore&rsquo;s war in 1774 and, afterward, from the opening of the
Revolution in 1775 until the close of the Indian wars in
Tennessee&mdash;a period extending over nearly twenty years&mdash;was
the acknowledged leader or organizer in every important Indian campaign
along the Tennessee border. His services in this connection have been
already noted. He also commanded one wing of the American forces at the
battle of King&rsquo;s mountain in 1780, and in 1783 led a body of
mountain men to the assistance of the patriots under Marion. At one
time during the Revolution a Tory plot to assassinate him was revealed
by the wife of the principal conspirator. In 1779 he had been
commissioned as commander of the militia of Washington county, North
Carolina&mdash;the nucleus of the present state of Tennessee&mdash;a
position which he had already held by common consent. Shortly after the
close of the Revolution he held for a short time the office of governor
of the seceding &ldquo;state of Franklin,&rdquo; for which he was
arrested and brought to trial by the government of North Carolina, but
made his escape, when the matter was allowed to drop. The question of
jurisdiction was finally settled in 1790, when North Carolina ceded the
disputed territory to the general government. Before this Sevier had
been commissioned as brigadier-general. When Tennessee was admitted as
a state in 1796 he was elected its first (state) governor, serving
three terms, or six years. In 1803 he was again reelected, serving
three more terms. In 1811 he was elected to Congress, where he served
two terms and was reelected to a third, but died before he could take
his seat, having contracted a fever while on duty as a boundary
commissioner among the Creeks, being then in his seventy-first year.
For more than forty years he had been continuously in the service of
his country, and no man of his state was ever more loved and respected.
In the prime of his manhood he was reputed the handsomest man and the
best Indian fighter in Tennessee.</p>
<p>(25) <span class="sc">Hopewell, South Carolina</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb61" class="pageref">61</a>): This place, designated in early
treaties and also in Hawkins&rsquo;s manuscript journal as
&ldquo;Hopewell on the Keowee,&rdquo; was the plantation seat of
General Andrew Pickens, who resided there from the close of the
Revolution until his death in 1817. It was situated on the northern
edge of the present Anderson county, on the east side of Keowee river,
opposite and a short distance below the entrance of Little river, and
about three miles from the present Pendleton. In sight of it, on the
opposite side of Keowee, was the old Cherokee town of Seneca, destroyed
by the Americans in 1776. Important treaties were made here with the
Cherokee in 1785, and with the Chickasaw in 1786.</p>
<p>(26) <span class="sc">Colonel Benjamin Hawkins</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb61" class="pageref">61</a>): This distinguished soldier, statesman,
and author, was born in Warren county, North Carolina, in 1754, and
died at Hawkinsville, Georgia, in 1816. His father, Colonel Philemon
Hawkins, organized and commanded a regiment in the Revolutionary war,
and was a member of the convention that ratified the national
constitution. At the outbreak of the Revolution young Hawkins was a
student at Princeton, but offered his services to the American cause,
and on account of his knowledge of French and other modern languages
was appointed by Washington his staff interpreter for communicating
with the French officers cooperating with the American army. He took
part in several engagements and was afterward appointed commissioner
for procuring war supplies abroad. After the close of the war he was
elected to Congress, and in 1785 was appointed on the commission which
negotiated at Hopewell the first federal treaty with the Cherokee. He
served a second term in the House and another in the Senate, and in
1796 was appointed superintendent for all the Indians south of the
Ohio. He thereupon removed to the Creek country and established himself
in the wilderness at what is now Hawkinsville, Georgia, where he
remained in the continuance of his office until his death. As Senator
he signed the deed by which North Carolina ceded Tennessee to the
United States in 1790, and as Indian superintendent helped to negotiate
seven different treaties with the southern tribes. He had an extensive
knowledge of the customs and language of the Creeks, and his
&ldquo;Sketch of the Creek <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href=
"#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>Country,&rdquo; written in 1799
and published by the Historical Society of Georgia in 1848, remains a
standard. His journal and other manuscripts are in possession of the
same society, while a manuscript Cherokee vocabulary is in possession
of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.

<p>(27) <span class="sc">Governor William Blount</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb68" class="pageref">68</a>): William Blount, territorial governor
of Tennessee, was born in North Carolina in 1744 and died at Knoxville,
Tennessee, in 1800. He held several important offices in his native
state, including two terms in the assembly and two others as delegate
to the old congress, in which latter capacity he was one of the signers
of the Federal constitution in 1787. On the organization of a
territorial government for Tennessee in 1790, he was appointed
territorial governor and also superintendent for the southern tribes,
fixing his headquarters at Knoxville. In 1791 he negotiated an
important treaty with the Cherokee, and had much to do with directing
the operations against the Indians until the close of the Indian war.
He was president of the convention which organized the state of
Tennessee in 1796, and was elected to the national senate, but was
expelled on the charge of having entered into a treasonable conspiracy
to assist the British in conquering Louisiana from Spain. A United
States officer was sent to arrest him, but returned without executing
his mission on being warned by Blount&rsquo;s friends that they would
not allow him to be taken from the state. The impeachment proceedings
against him were afterward dismissed on technical grounds. In the
meantime the people of his own state had shown their confidence in him
by electing him to the state senate, of which he was chosen president.
He died at the early age of fifty-three, the most popular man in the
state next to Sevier. His younger brother, Willie Blount, who had been
his secretary, was afterward governor of Tennessee,
1809&ndash;1815.</p>
<p>(28) <span class="sc">St Clair&rsquo;s defeat</span>, 1791 (p.
<a href="#pb72" class="pageref">72</a>): Early in 1791 Major-General
Arthur St Clair, a veteran officer in two wars and governor of the
Northwestern Territory, was appointed to the chief command of the army
operating against the Ohio tribes. On November 4 of that year, while
advancing upon the Miami villages with an army of 1,400 men, he was
surprised by an Indian force of about the same number under
Little-turtle, the Miami chief, in what is now southwestern Mercer
county, Ohio, adjoining the Indiana line. Because of the cowardly
conduct of the militia he was totally defeated, with the loss of 632
officers and men killed and missing, and 263 wounded, many of whom
afterward died. The artillery was abandoned, not a horse being left
alive to draw it off, and so great was the panic that the men threw
away their arms and fled for miles, even after the pursuit had ceased.
It was afterward learned that the Indians lost 150 killed, besides many
wounded. Two years later General Wayne built Fort Recovery upon the
same spot. The detachment sent to do the work found within a space of
350 yards 500 skulls, while for several miles along the line of pursuit
the woods were strewn with skeletons and muskets. The two cannon lost
were found in the adjacent stream. <i>Authorities</i>: St Clair&rsquo;s

<p>(29) <span class="sc">Cherokee clans</span>, (p. <a href="#pb74"
class="pageref">74</a>): The Cherokee have seven clans, viz:
Ani&prime;-Wa&prime;&#699;ya, Wolf; Ani&prime;-Kaw&#301;&prime;, Deer;
Ani&prime;-Tsi&prime;skwa, Bird; Ani&prime;-W&acirc;&prime;d&#301;,
Paint; Ani&prime;-Sah&acirc;&prime;n&#301;;
Ani&prime;-Ga&prime;t&acirc;ge&prime;w&#301;;
Ani&prime;-Gil&acirc;&prime;h&#301;. The names of the last three can
not be translated with certainty. The Wolf clan is the largest and most
important in the tribe. It is probable that, in accordance with the
general system in other tribes, each clan had formerly certain
hereditary duties and privileges, but no trace of these now remains.
Children belong to the clan of the mother, and the law forbidding
marriage between persons of the same clan is still enforced among the
conservative <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>full-bloods. The &ldquo;seven clans&rdquo; are
frequently mentioned in the sacred formulas, and even in some of the
tribal laws promulgated within the century. There is evidence that
originally there were fourteen, which by extinction or absorption have
been reduced to seven; thus, the ancient Turtle-dove and Raven clans
now constitute a single Bird clan. The subject will be discussed more
fully in a future Cherokee paper.</p>
<p>(30) <span class="sc">Wayne&rsquo;s victory</span>, 1794 (p.
<a href="#pb78" class="pageref">78</a>): After the successive failures
of Harmar and St Clair in their efforts against the Ohio tribes the
chief command was assigned, in 1793, to Major-General Anthony Wayne,
who had already distinguished himself by his fighting qualities during
the Revolution. Having built Fort Recovery on the site of St
Clair&rsquo;s defeat, he made that post his headquarters through the
winter of 1793&ndash;94. In the summer of 1794 he advanced down the
Maumee with an army of 3,000 men, two-thirds of whom were regulars. On
August 20 he encountered the confederated Indian forces near the head
of the Maumee rapids at a point known as the Fallen Timbers and
defeated them with great slaughter, the pursuit being followed up by
the cavalry until the Indians took refuge under the guns of the British
garrison at Fort Miami, just below the rapids. His own loss was only 33
killed and 100 wounded, of whom 11 afterward died of their wounds. The
loss of the Indians and their white auxiliaries was believed to be more
than double this. The Indian force was supposed to number 2,000, while,
on account of the impetuosity of Wayne&rsquo;s charge, the number of
his troops actually engaged did not exceed 900. On account of this
defeat and the subsequent devastation of their towns and fields by the
victorious army the Indians were compelled to sue for peace, which was
granted by the treaty concluded at Greenville, Ohio, August 3, 1795, by
which the tribes represented ceded away nearly their whole territory in
Ohio. <i>Authorities</i>: Wayne&rsquo;s report and related documents,

<p>(31) <span class="sc">First things of civilization</span> (p.
<a href="#pb83" class="pageref">83</a>): We usually find that the first
things adopted by the Indian from his white neighbor are improved
weapons and cutting tools, with trinkets and articles of personal
adornment. After a regular trade has been established certain traders
marry Indian wives, and, taking up their permanent residence in the
Indian country, engage in farming and stock raising according to
civilized methods, thus, even without intention, constituting
themselves industrial teachers for the tribe.</p>
<p>From data furnished by Haywood, guns appear to have been first
introduced among the Cherokee about the year 1700 or 1710, although he
himself puts the date much earlier. Horses were probably not owned in
any great number before the marking out of the horse-path for traders
from Augusta about 1740. The Cherokee, however, took kindly to the
animal, and before the beginning of the war of 1760 had a
&ldquo;prodigious number.&rdquo; In spite of their great losses at that
time they had so far recovered in 1775 that almost every man then had
from two to a dozen (Adair, p. 231). In the border wars following the
Revolution companies of hundreds of mounted Cherokee and Creeks
sometimes invaded the settlements. The cow is called <i>wa&prime;ka</i>
by the Cherokee and <i>waga</i> by the Creeks, indicating that their
first knowledge of it came through the Spaniards. Nuttall states that
it was first introduced among the Cherokee by the celebrated Nancy Ward
(Travels, p. 130). It was not in such favor as the horse, being
valuable chiefly for food, of which at that time there was an abundant
supply from the wild game. A potent reason for its avoidance was the
Indian belief that the eating of the flesh of a slow-moving animal
breeds a corresponding sluggishness in the eater. The same argument
applied even more strongly to the hog, and to this day a few of the old
conservatives among the East Cherokee will have nothing to do with
beef, pork, milk, or butter. Nevertheless, Bartram tells of a trader in
the Cherokee country as early as 1775 who had a stock <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>of
cattle, and whose Indian wife had learned to make butter and cheese
(Travels, p. 347). In 1796 Hawkins mentions meeting two Cherokee women
driving ten very fat cattle to market in the white settlements
(manuscript journal, 1796). Bees, if not native, as the Indians claim,
were introduced at so early a period that the Indians have forgotten
their foreign origin. The De Soto narrative mentions the finding of a
pot of honey in an Indian village in Georgia in 1540. The peach was
cultivated in orchards a century before the Revolution, and one
variety, known as early as 1700 as the Indian peach, the Indians
claimed as their own, asserting that they had had it before the whites
came to America (Lawson, Carolina, p. 182, ed. 1860). Potatoes were
introduced early and were so much esteemed that, according to one old
informant, the Indians in Georgia, before the Removal, &ldquo;lived on
them.&rdquo; Coffee came later, and the same informant remembered when
the full-bloods still considered it poison, in spite of the efforts of
the chief, Charles Hicks, to introduce it among them.</p>
<p>Spinning wheels and looms were introduced shortly before the
Revolution. According to the Wahnenauhi manuscript the first among the
Cherokee were brought over from England by an Englishman named Edward
Graves, who taught his Cherokee wife to spin and weave. The anonymous
writer may have confounded this early civilizer with a young Englishman
who was employed by Agent Hawkins in 1801 to make wheels and looms for
the Creeks (Hawkins, 1801, in American State Papers: Indian Affairs,
<span class="sc">I</span>, p. 647). Wafford, in his boyhood, say about
1815, knew an old man named Ts&#301;&prime;naw&#301; on Young-cane
creek of Nottely river, in upper Georgia, who was known as a
wheelwright and was reputed to have made the first spinning wheel and
loom ever made among the mountain Cherokee, or perhaps in the Nation,
long before Wafford&rsquo;s time, or &ldquo;about the time the Cherokee
began to drop their silver ornaments and go to work.&rdquo; In 1785 the
commissioners for the Hopewell treaty reported that some of the
Cherokee women had lately learned to spin, and many were very desirous
of instruction in the raising, spinning, and weaving of flax, cotton,
and wool (Hopewell Commissioners&rsquo; Report, 1785, American State
Papers: Indian Affairs, <span class="sc">I</span>, p. 39). In
accordance with their recommendation the next treaty made with the
tribe, in 1791, contained a provision for supplying the Cherokee with
farming tools (Holston treaty, 1791, Indian Treaties, p. 36, 1837), and
this civilizing policy was continued and broadened until, in 1801,
their agent reported that at the Cherokee agency the wheel, the loom,
and the plow were in pretty general use, and farming, manufacturing,
and stock raising were the principal topics of conversation among men
and women (Hawkins manuscripts, Treaty Commission of 1801).</p>
<p>(32) <span class="sc">Colonel Return J. Meigs</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb84" class="pageref">84</a>): Return Jonathan Meigs was born in
Middletown, Connecticut, December 17, 1734, and died at the Cherokee
agency in Tennessee, January 28, 1823. He was the first-born son of his
parents, who gave him the somewhat peculiar name of Return Jonathan to
commemorate a romantic incident in their own courtship, when his
mother, a young Quakeress, called back her lover as he was mounting his
horse to leave the house forever after what he had supposed was a final
refusal. The name has been handed down through five generations, every
one of which has produced some man distinguished in the public service.
The subject of this sketch volunteered immediately after the opening
engagement of the Revolution at Lexington, and was assigned to duty
under Arnold, with rank of major. He accompanied Arnold in the
disastrous march through the wilderness against Quebec, and was
captured in the assault upon the citadel and held until exchanged the
next year. In 1777 he raised a regiment and was promoted to the rank of
colonel. For a gallant and successful attack upon the enemy at Sag
harbor, Long island, he received a sword and a vote of thanks from
Congress, and by his conduct at the head of his regiment at Stony point
won the favorable notice of Washington. After the close of the
Revolution he removed to Ohio, where, as a member of the territorial
legislature, he drew up the earliest code of regulations <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>for
the pioneer settlers. In 1801 he was appointed agent for the Cherokee
and took up his residence at the agency at Tellico blockhouse, opposite
the mouth of Tellico river, in Tennessee, continuing to serve in that
capacity until his death. He was succeeded as agent by Governor McMinn,
of Tennessee. In the course of twenty-two years he negotiated several
treaties with the Cherokee and did much to further the work of
civilization among them and to defend them against unjust aggression.
He also wrote a journal of the expedition to Quebec. His grandson of
the same name was special agent for the Cherokee and Creeks in 1834,
afterward achieving a reputation in the legal profession both in
Tennessee and in the District of Columbia. <i>Authorities</i>:

<p>(33) <span class="sc">Tecumtha</span> (p. <a href="#pb87" class=
"pageref">87</a>): This great chief of the Shawano and commander of the
allied northern tribes in the British service was born near the present
Chillicothe, in western Ohio, about 1770, and fell in the battle of the
Thames, in Ontario, October 5, 1813. His name signifies a &ldquo;flying
panther&rdquo;&mdash;i. e., a meteor. He came of fighting stock good
even in a tribe distinguished for its warlike qualities, his father and
elder brother having been killed in battle with the whites. His mother
is said to have died among the Cherokee. Tecumtha is first heard of as
taking part in an engagement with the Kentuckians when about twenty
years old, and in a few years he had secured recognition as the ablest
leader among the allied tribes. It is said that he took part in every
important engagement with the Americans from the time of Harmar&rsquo;s
defeat in 1790 until the battle in which he lost his life. When about
thirty years of age he conceived the idea of uniting the tribes
northwest of the Ohio, as Pontiac had united them before, in a great
confederacy to resist the further advance of the Americans, taking the
stand that the whole territory between the Ohio and the Mississippi
belonged to all these tribes in common and that no one tribe had the
right to sell any portion of it without the consent of the others. The
refusal of the government to admit this principle led him to take
active steps to unite the tribes upon that basis, in which he was
seconded by his brother, the Prophet, who supplemented Tecumtha&rsquo;s
eloquence with his own claims to supernatural revelation. In the summer
of 1810 Tecumtha held a conference with Governor Harrison at Vincennes
to protest against a recent treaty cession, and finding after
exhausting his arguments that the effort was fruitless, he closed the
debate with the words: &ldquo;The President is far off and may sit in
his town and drink his wine, but you and I will have to fight it
out.&rdquo; Both sides at once prepared for war, Tecumtha going south
to enlist the aid of the Creek, Choctaw, and other southern tribes,
while Harrison took advantage of his absence to force the issue by
marching against the Prophet&rsquo;s town on the Tippecanoe river,
where the hostile warriors from a dozen tribes had gathered. A battle
fought before daybreak of November 6, 1811, resulted in the defeat of
the Indians and the scattering of their forces. Tecumtha returned to
find his plans brought to naught for the time, but the opening of the
war between the United States and England a few months later enabled
him to rally the confederated tribes once more to the support of the
British against the Americans. As a commissioned brigadier-general in
the British service he commanded 2,000 warriors in the war of 1812,
distinguishing himself no less by his bravery than by his humanity in
preventing outrages and protecting prisoners from massacre, at one time
saving the lives of four hundred American prisoners who had been taken
in ambush near Fort Meigs and were unable to make longer resistance. He
was wounded at Maguagua, where nearly four hundred were killed and
wounded on both sides. He covered the British retreat after the battle
of Lake Erie, and, refusing to retreat farther, compelled the British
General Proctor to make a stand at the Thames river. Almost the whole
force of the American attack fell on Tecumtha&rsquo;s division. Early
in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>engagement he was shot through the arm, but
continued to fight desperately until he received a bullet in the head
and fell dead, surrounded by the bodies of 120 of his slain warriors.
The services of Tecumtha and his Indians to the British cause have been
recognized by an English historian, who says, &ldquo;but for them it is
probable we should not now have a Canada.&rdquo; <i>Authorities</i>:

<p>(34) <span class="sc">Fort Mims Massacre</span>, 1813 (p. <a href=
"#pb89" class="pageref">89</a>): Fort Mims, so called from an old
Indian trader on whose lands it was built, was a stockade fort erected
in the summer of 1813 for the protection of the settlers in what was
known as the Tensaw district, and was situated on Tensaw lake, Alabama,
one mile east of Alabama river and about forty miles above Mobile. It
was garrisoned by about 200 volunteer troops under Major Daniel
Beasley, with refugees from the neighboring settlement, making a total
at the time of its destruction of 553 men, women, and children. Being
carelessly guarded, it was surprised on the morning of August 30 by
about 1,000 Creek warriors led by the mixed-blood chief, William
Weatherford, who rushed in at the open gate, and, after a stout but
hopeless resistance by the garrison, massacred all within, with the
exception of the few negroes and halfbreeds, whom they spared, and
about a dozen whites who made their escape. The Indian loss is unknown,
but was very heavy, as the fight continued at close quarters until the
buildings were fired over the heads of the defenders. The unfortunate
tragedy was due entirely to the carelessness of the commanding officer,
who had been repeatedly warned that the Indians were about, and at the
very moment of the attack a negro was tied up waiting to be flogged for
reporting that he had the day before seen a number of painted warriors
lurking a short distance outside the stockade. <i>Authorities</i>:

<p>(35) <span class="sc">General William McIntosh</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb98" class="pageref">98</a>): This noted halfbreed chief of the
Lower Creeks was the son of a Scotch officer in the British army by an
Indian mother, and was born at the Creek town of Coweta in Alabama, on
the lower Chattahoochee, nearly opposite the present city of Columbus,
Georgia, and killed at the same place by order of the Creek national
council on April 30, 1825. Having sufficient education to keep up an
official correspondence, he brought himself to public notice and came
to be regarded as the principal chief of the Lower Creeks. In the Creek
war of 1813&ndash;14 he led his warriors to the support of the
Americans against his brethren of the Upper towns, and acted a leading
part in the terrible slaughters at Autossee and the Horseshoe bend. In
1817 he again headed his warriors on the government side against the
Seminole and was commissioned as major. His common title of general
belonged to him only by courtesy. In 1821 he was the principal
supporter of the treaty of Indian springs, by which a large tract
between the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers was ceded. The treaty was
repudiated by the Creek Nation as being the act of a small faction. Two
other attempts were made to carry through the treaty, in which the
interested motives of McIntosh became so apparent that he was branded
as a traitor to his Nation and condemned to death, together with his
principal underlings, in accordance with a Creek law making death the
penalty for undertaking to sell lands without the consent of the
national council. About the same time he was publicly exposed and
denounced in the Cherokee council for an attempt to bribe John Ross and
other chiefs of the Cherokee in the same fashion. At daylight of April
30, 1825, a hundred or more warriors sent by the Creek national council
surrounded his house and, after allowing the women and children to come
out, set fire to it and shot McIntosh and another chief <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>as
they tried to escape. He left three wives, one of whom was a Cherokee.

<p>(36) <span class="sc">William Weatherford</span> (p. <a href="#pb89"
class="pageref">89</a>): This leader of the hostiles in the Creek war
was the son of a white father and a halfbreed woman of Tuskegee town
whose father had been a Scotchman. Weatherford was born in the Creek
Nation about 1780 and died on Little river, in Monroe county, Alabama,
in 1826. He came first into prominence by leading the attack upon Fort
Mims, August 30, 1813, which resulted in the destruction of the fort
and the massacre of over five hundred inmates. It is maintained, with
apparent truth, that he did his best to prevent the excesses which
followed the victory, and left the scene rather than witness the
atrocities when he found that he could not restrain his followers. The
fact that Jackson allowed him to go home unmolested after the final
surrender is evidence that he believed Weatherford guiltless. At the
battle of the Holy Ground, in the following December, he was defeated
and narrowly escaped capture by the troops under General Claiborne.
When the last hope of the Creeks had been destroyed and their power of
resistance broken by the bloody battle of the Horseshoe bend, March 27,
1814, Weatherford voluntarily walked into General Jackson&rsquo;s
headquarters and surrendered, creating such an impression by his
straightforward and fearless manner that the general, after a friendly
interview, allowed him to go back alone to gather up his people
preliminary to arranging terms of peace. After the treaty he retired to
a plantation in Monroe county, where he lived in comfort and was
greatly respected by his white neighbors until his death. As an
illustration of his courage it is told how he once, single-handed,

<p>(37) <span class="sc">Reverend David Brainerd</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb104" class="pageref">104</a>): The pioneer American missionary from
whom the noted Cherokee mission took its name was born at Haddam,
Connecticut, April 20, 1718, and died at Northampton, Massachusetts,
October 9, 1747. He entered Yale college in 1739, but was expelled on
account of his religious opinions. In 1742 he was licensed as a
preacher and the next year began work as missionary to the Mahican
Indians of the village of Kaunameek, twenty miles from Stockbridge,
Massachusetts. He persuaded them to remove to Stockbridge, where he put
them in charge of a resident minister, after which he took up work with
good result among the Delaware and other tribes on the Delaware and
Susquehanna rivers. In 1747 his health failed and he was forced to
retire to Northampton, where he died a few months later. He wrote a
journal and an account of his missionary labors at Kaunameek. His later
mission work was taken up and continued by his brother.

<p>(38) <span class="sc">Reverend Samuel Austin Worcester</span> (p.
<a href="#pb105" class="pageref">105</a>): This noted missionary and
philologist, the son of a Congregational minister who was also a
printer, was born at Worcester, Massachusetts, January 19, 1798, and
died at Park Hill, in the Cherokee Nation west, April 20, 1859. Having
removed to Vermont with his father while still a child, he graduated
with the honors of his class at the state university at Burlington in
1819, and after finishing a course at the theological seminary at
Andover was ordained to the ministry in 1825. A week later, with his
newly wedded bride, he left Boston to begin mission work among the
Cherokee, and arrived in October at the mission of the American board,
at Brainerd, Tennessee, where he remained until the end of 1827. He
then, with his wife, removed to New Echota, in Georgia, the capital of
the Cherokee Nation, where he was the principal worker in the
establishment of the <i>Cherokee Ph&oelig;nix</i>, the first newspaper
printed in the Cherokee <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href=
"#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>language and alphabet. In this
labor his inherited printer&rsquo;s instinct came into play, for he
himself supervised the casting of the new types and the systematic
arrangement of them in the case. In March, 1831, he was arrested by the
Georgia authorities for refusing to take a special oath of allegiance
to the state. He was released, but was rearrested soon afterward,
confined in the state penitentiary, and forced to wear prison garb,
until January, 1833, notwithstanding a decision by the Supreme Court of
the United States, nearly a year before, that his imprisonment was a
violation of the law of the land. The <i>Cherokee Ph&oelig;nix</i>
having been suspended and the Cherokee Nation brought into disorder by
the extension over it of the state laws, he then returned to Brainerd,
which was beyond the limits of Georgia. In 1835 he removed to the
Indian Territory, whither the Arkansas Cherokee had already gone, and
after short sojourns at Dwight and Union missions took up his final
residence at Park Hill in December, 1836. He had already set up his
mission press at Union, printing both in the Cherokee and the Creek
languages, and on establishing himself at Park Hill he began a regular
series of publications in the Cherokee language. In 1843 he states that
&ldquo;at Park Hill, besides the preaching of the gospel, a leading
object of attention is the preparation and publication of books in the
Cherokee language&rdquo; (Letter in Report of Indian Commissioner, p.
356, 1843). The list of his Cherokee publications (first editions)
under his own name in Pilling&rsquo;s Bibliography comprises about
twenty titles, including the Bible, hymn books, tracts, and almanacs in
addition to the <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i> and large number of anonymous
works. Says Pilling: &ldquo;It is very probable that he was the
translator of a number of books for which he is not given credit here,
especially those portions of the Scripture which are herein not
assigned to any name. Indeed it is safe to say that during the
thirty-four years of his connection with the Cherokee but little was
done in the way of translating in which he had not a share.&rdquo; He
also began a Cherokee geography and had both a grammar and a dictionary
of the language under way when his work was interrupted by his arrest.
The manuscripts, with all his personal effects, afterward went down
with a sinking steamer on the Arkansas. His daughter, Mrs A. E. W.
Robertson, became a missionary among the Creeks and has published a
number of works in their language. <i>Authorities</i>: Pilling,

<p>(39) <span class="sc">Death penalty for selling lands</span> (p.
<a href="#pb107" class="pageref">107</a>): In 1820 the Cherokee Nation
enacted a law making it treason punishable with death to enter into any
negotiation for the sale of tribal lands without the consent of the
national council. A similar law was enacted by the Creeks at about the
same time. It was for violating these laws that McIntosh and Ridge
suffered death in their respective tribes. The principal parts of the
Cherokee law, as reenacted by the united Nation in the West in 1842,
appear as follows in the compilation authorized in 1866:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">An act against sale of land, etc.</span>:
<i>Whereas</i>, The peace and prosperity of Indian nations are
frequently sacrificed or placed in jeopardy by the unrestrained
cupidity of their own individual citizens; <i>and whereas</i>, we
ourselves are liable to suffer from the same cause, and be subjected to
future removal and disturbances: Therefore, &hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Be it further enacted</i>, That any person or persons who
shall, contrary to the will and consent of the legislative council of
this nation, in general council convened, enter into a treaty with any
commissioner or commissioners of the United States, or any officer or
officers instructed for the purpose, and agree to cede, exchange, or
dispose in any way any part or portion of the lands belonging to or
claimed by the Cherokees, west of the Mississippi, he or they so
offending, upon conviction before any judge of the circuit or supreme
courts, <i>shall suffer death</i>, and any of the aforesaid judges are

abscond, are hereby declared to be outlaws; and any person or persons,
citizens of this nation, may kill him or them so offending at any time
and in any manner most convenient, within the limits of this nation,

<p>(40) <span class="sc">The Cherokee syllabary</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb110" class="pageref">110</a>): In the various schemes of symbolic
thought representation, from the simple pictograph of the primitive man
to the finished alphabet of the civilized nations, our own system,
although not yet perfect, stands at the head of the list, the result of
three thousand years of development by Egyptian, Ph&oelig;nician, and
Greek. Sequoya&rsquo;s syllabary, the unaided work of an uneducated
Indian reared amid semisavage surroundings, stands second.</p>
<p>Twelve years of his life are said to have been given to his great
work. Being entirely without instruction and having no knowledge of the
philosophy of language, being not even acquainted with English, his
first attempts were naturally enough in the direction of the crude
Indian pictograph. He set out to devise a symbol for each word of the
language, and after several years of experiment, finding this an
utterly hopeless task, he threw aside the thousands of characters which
he had carved or scratched upon pieces of bark, and started in anew to
study the construction of the language itself. By attentive observation
for another long period he finally discovered that the sounds in the
words used by the Cherokee in their daily conversation and their public
speeches could be analyzed and classified, and that the thousands of
possible words were all formed from varying combinations of hardly more
than a hundred distinct syllables. Having thoroughly tested his
discovery until satisfied of its correctness, he next proceeded to
formulate a symbol for each syllable. For this purpose he made use of a
number of characters which he found in an old English spelling book,
picking out capitals, lower-case, italics, and figures, and placing
them right side up or upside down, without any idea of their sound or
significance as used in English (see plate <span class="sc">v</span>).
Having thus utilized some thirty-five ready-made characters, to which
must be added a dozen or more produced by modification of the same
originals, he designed from his own imagination as many more as were
necessary to his purpose, making eighty-five in all. The complete
syllabary, as first elaborated, would have required some one hundred
and fifteen characters, but after much hard study over the hissing
sound in its various combinations, he hit upon the expedient of
representing the sound by means of a distinct character&mdash;the exact
equivalent of our letter <i>s</i>&mdash;whenever it formed the initial
of a syllable. Says Gallatin, &ldquo;It wanted but one step more, and
to have also given a distinct character to each consonant, to reduce
the whole number to sixteen, and to have had an alphabet similar to
ours. In practice, however, and as applied to his own language, the
superiority of Guess&rsquo;s alphabet is manifest, and has been fully
proved by experience. You must indeed learn and remember eighty-five
characters instead of twenty-five [<i>sic</i>]. But this once
accomplished, the education of the pupil is completed; he can read and
he is perfect in his orthography without making it the subject of a
distinct study. The boy learns in a few weeks that which occupies two
years of the time of ours.&rdquo; Says Phillips: &ldquo;In my own
observation Indian children will take one or two, at times several,
years to master the English printed and written language, but in a few
days can read and write in Cherokee. They do the latter, in fact, as
soon as they learn to shape letters. As soon as they master the
alphabet they have got rid of all the perplexing questions in
orthography that puzzle the brains of our children. It is not too much
to say that a child will learn in a month, by the same effort, as
thoroughly in the language <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href=
"#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>of Sequoyah, that which in ours
consumes the time of our children for at least two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although in theory the written Cherokee word has one letter for each
syllable, the rule does not always hold good in practice, owing to the
frequent elision of vowel sounds. Thus the word for &ldquo;soul&rdquo;
is written with four letters as <i>a-da-n&ucirc;&ntilde;-ta</i>, but
pronounced in three syllables, <i>adanta</i>. In the same way
<i>ts&acirc;-l&ucirc;&ntilde;-i-yu-sti</i> (&ldquo;like tobacco,&rdquo;
the cardinal flower) is pronounced <i>ts&acirc;liyust&#301;</i>. There
are also, as in other languages, a number of minute sound variations
not indicated in the written word, so that it is necessary to have
heard the language spoken in order to read with correct pronunciation.
The old Upper dialect is the standard to which the alphabet has been
adapted. There is no provision for the <i>r</i> of the Lower or the
<i>sh</i> of the Middle dialect, each speaker usually making his own
dialectic change in the reading. The letters of a word are not
connected, and there is no difference between the written and the
printed character. <i>Authorities</i>: Gallatin, Synopsis of the Indian

<p>(41) <span class="sc">Southern gold fields</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb116" class="pageref">116</a>): Almost every valuable mineral and
crystal known to the manufacturer or the lapidary is found in the
southern Alleghenies, although, so far as present knowledge goes, but
few of these occur in paying quantities. It is probable, however, that
this estimate may change with improved methods and enlarged railroad
facilities. Leaving out of account the earlier operations by the
Spanish, French, and English adventurers, of which mention has already
been made, the first authentic account of gold finding in any of the
states south of Mason and Dixon&rsquo;s line within what maybe called
the American period appears to be that given by Jefferson, writing in
1781, of a lump of ore found in Virginia, which yielded seventeen
pennyweights of gold. This was probably not the earliest, however, as
we find doubtful references to gold discoveries in both Carolinas
before the Revolution. The first mint returns of gold were made from
North Carolina in 1793, and from South Carolina in 1829, although gold
is certainly known to have been found in the latter state some years
earlier. The earliest gold records for the other southern states are,
approximately, Georgia (near Dahlonega), 1815&ndash;1820; Alabama,
1830; Tennessee (Coco creek, Monroe county), 1831; Maryland (Montgomery
county), 1849. Systematic tracing of gold belts southward from North
Carolina began in 1829, and speedily resulted in the forcible eviction
of the Cherokee from the gold-bearing region. Most of the precious
metal was procured from placers or alluvial deposits by a simple
process of digging and washing. Very little quartz mining has yet been
attempted, and that usually by the crudest methods. In fact, for a long
period gold working was followed as a sort of side issue to farming
between crop seasons. In North Carolina prospectors obtained permission
from the owners of the land to wash or dig on shares, varying from
one-fourth to one-half, and the proprietor was accustomed to put his
slaves to work in the same way along the creek bottoms after the crops
had been safely gathered. &ldquo;The dust became a considerable medium
of circulation, and miners were accustomed to carry about with them
quills filled with gold, and a pair of small hand scales, on which they
weighed out gold at regular rates; for instance, 3&frac12; grains of
gold was the customary equivalent of a pint of whisky.&rdquo; For a
number of years, about 1830 and later, a man named Bechtler coined gold
on his own account in North Carolina, and these coins, with Mexican
silver, are said to have constituted the chief currency over a large
region. A regular mint was established at Dahlonega in 1838 and
maintained for some years. From 1804 to 1827 all the gold produced in
the United States came from North Carolina, although the total amounted
to but $110,000. The discovery of the rich deposits in California
checked mining operations in the south, and the civil war brought about
an almost complete suspension, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221"
href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>from which there is hardly
yet a revival. According to the best official estimates the gold
production of the southern Allegheny region for the century from 1799
to 1898, inclusive, has been something over $46,000,000, distributed as
follows:</p>

welcomed the Moravian missionaries and gave his own house for their

the Cherokee Nation and having to go with their people to the West, do
leave this monument, not only to show their regard for their parents,
but to guard their sacred ashes against the unhallowed intrusion of the

<p>(45) <i>President Samuel Houston</i>, (p. <a href="#pb145" class=
"pageref">145</a>): This remarkable man was born in Rockbridge county,
Virginia, March 2, 1793, and died at Huntsville, Texas, July 25, 1863.
Of strangely versatile, but forceful, character, he occupies a unique
position in American history, combining in a wonderful degree the rough
manhood of the pioneer, the eccentric vanity of the Indian, the stern
dignity of the soldier, the genius of the statesman, and withal the
high chivalry of a knight of the olden time. His erratic career has
been the subject of much cheap romancing, but the simple facts are of
sufficient interest in themselves without the aid of fictitious
embellishment. To the Cherokee, whom he loved so well, he was known as
K&acirc;&prime;lan&ucirc;, &ldquo;The Raven,&rdquo; an old war title in
the tribe.</p>
<p>His father having died when the boy was nine years old, his widowed
mother removed with him to Tennessee, opposite the territory of the
Cherokee, whose boundary was then the Tennessee river. Here he worked
on the farm, attending school at intervals; but, being of adventurous
disposition, he left home when sixteen years old, and, crossing over
the river, joined the Cherokee, among whom he soon became a great
favorite, being adopted into the family of Chief Jolly, from whom the
island at the mouth of Hiwassee takes its name. After three years of
this life, during which time he wore the Indian dress and learned the
Indian language, he returned to civilization and enlisted as a private
soldier under Jackson in the Creek war. He soon attracted favorable
notice and was promoted to the rank of ensign. By striking bravery at
the bloody battle of Horseshoe bend, where he scaled the breastworks
with an arrow in his thigh and led his men into the thick of the enemy,
he won the lasting friendship of Jackson, who made him a lieutenant,
although he was then barely twenty-one. He continued in the army after
the war, serving for a time as subagent for the Cherokee at
Jackson&rsquo;s request, until the summer of 1818, when he resigned on
account of some criticism by Calhoun, then Secretary of War. An
official investigation, held at his demand, resulted in his
exoneration.</p>
<p>Removing to Nashville, he began the study of law, and, being shortly
afterward admitted to the bar, set up in practice at Lebanon. Within
five years he was successively district attorney and adjutant-general
and major-general of state troops. In 1823 he was elected to Congress,
serving two terms, at the end of which, in 1827, he was elected
governor of Tennessee by an overwhelming majority, being then
thirty-four years of age. Shortly before this time he had fought and
wounded General White in a duel. In January, 1829, he married a young
lady residing near Nashville, but two months later, without a word of
explanation to any outsider, he left her, resigned his governorship and
other official dignities, and left the state forever, to rejoin his old
friends, the Cherokee, in the West. For years the reason for this
strange conduct was a secret, and Houston himself always refused to
talk of it, but it is now understood to have been due to the fact that
his wife admitted to him that she loved another and had only been
induced to marry him by the over-persuasions of her parents.</p>
<p>From Tennessee he went to Indian Territory, whither a large part of
the Cherokee had already removed, and once more took up his residence
near Chief Jolly, who was now the principal chief of the western
Cherokee. The great disappointment which seemed to have blighted his
life at its brightest was heavy at his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>heart, and he sought
forgetfulness in drink to such an extent that for a time his manhood
seemed to have departed, notwithstanding which, such was his force of
character and his past reputation, he retained his hold upon the
affections of the Cherokee and his standing with the officers and their
families at the neighboring posts of Fort Smith, Fort Gibson, and Fort
Coffee. In the meantime his former wife in Tennessee had obtained a
divorce, and Houston being thus free once more soon after married
Talihina, the youngest daughter of a prominent mixed-blood Cherokee
named Rogers, who resided near Fort Gibson. She was the niece of
Houston&rsquo;s adopted father, Chief Jolly, and he had known her when
a boy in the old Nation. Being a beautiful girl, and educated above her
surroundings, she became a welcome guest wherever her husband was
received. He started a trading store near Webbers Falls, but continued
in his dissipated habits until recalled to his senses by the outcome of
a drunken affray in which he assaulted his adopted father, the old
chief, and was himself felled to the ground unconscious. Upon recovery
from his injuries he made a public apology for his conduct and
thenceforward led a sober life.</p>
<p>In 1832 he visited Washington in the interest of the western
Cherokee, calling in Indian costume upon President Jackson, who
received him with old-time friendship. Being accused while there of
connection with a fraudulent Indian contract, he administered a severe
beating to his accuser, a member of Congress. For this he was fined
$500 and reprimanded by the bar of the House, but Jackson remitted the
fine. Soon after his return to the West he removed to Texas to take
part in the agitation just started against Mexican rule. He was a
member of the convention which adopted a separate constitution for
Texas in 1833, and two years later aided in forming a provisional
government, and was elected commander-in-chief to organize the new
militia. In 1836 he was a member of the convention which declared the
independence of Texas. At the battle of San Jacinto in April of that
year he defeated with 750 men Santa Ana&rsquo;s army of 1,800,
inflicting upon the Mexicans the terrible loss of 630 killed and 730
prisoners, among whom was Santa Ana himself. Houston received a severe
wound in the engagement. In the autumn of the same year he was elected
first president of the republic of Texas, receiving more than
four-fifths of the votes cast. He served two years and retired at the
end of his term, leaving the country on good terms with both Mexico and
the Indian tribes, and with its notes at par. He was immediately
elected to the Texas congress and served in that capacity until 1841,
when he was reelected president. It was during these years that he made
his steadfast fight in behalf of the Texas Cherokee, as is narrated
elsewhere, supporting their cause without wavering, at the risk of his
own popularity and position. He frequently declared that no treaty made
and carried out in good faith had ever been violated by Indians. His
Cherokee wife having died some time before, he was again married in
1840, this time to a lady from Alabama, who exercised over him a
restraining and ennobling influence through the stormy vicissitudes of
his eventful life. In June, 1842, he vetoed a bill making him dictator
for the purpose of resisting a threatened invasion from Mexico.</p>
<p>On December 29, 1845, Texas was admitted to the Union, and in the
following March Houston was elected to the Senate, where he served
continuously until 1859, when he resigned to take his seat as governor,
to which position he had just been elected. From 1852 to 1860 his name
was three times presented before national presidential nominating
conventions, the last time receiving 57 votes. He had taken issue with
the Democratic majority throughout his term in the Senate, and when
Texas passed the secession ordinance in February, 1861, being an
uncompromising Union man, he refused to take the oath of allegiance to
the Confederacy and was accordingly deposed from the office of
governor, declining the proffered aid of federal troops to keep him in
his seat. Unwilling either to fight against the Union or to take sides
against his friends, he held aloof from the great struggle, and
remained in silent retirement until his death, two years later. No
other man in American history <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224"
href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>has left such a record of
continuous election to high office while steadily holding to his own
convictions in the face of strong popular opposition.

class="pageref">151</a>): This great chief of the Cherokee, whose name
is inseparable from their history, was himself but one-eighth of Indian
blood and showed little of the Indian features, his father, Daniel
Ross, having emigrated from Scotland before the Revolution and married
a quarter-blood Cherokee woman whose father, John McDonald, was also
from Scotland. He was born at or near the family residence at
Rossville, Georgia<span class="corr" id="xd25e7658" title=
"Not in source">,</span> just across the line from Chattanooga,
Tennessee. As a boy, he was known among the Cherokee as
Tsan-usdi&prime;, &ldquo;Little John,&rdquo; but after arriving at
manhood was called Guwi&prime;sguw&#301;&prime;, the name of a rare
migratory bird, of large size and white or grayish plumage, said to
have appeared formerly at long intervals in the old Cherokee country.
It may have been the egret or the swan. He was educated at Kingston,
Tennessee, and began his public career when barely nineteen years of
age. His first wife, a full-blood Cherokee woman, died in consequence
of the hardships of the Removal while on the western march and was
buried at Little Rock, Arkansas. Some years later he married again,
this time to a Miss Stapler of Wilmington, Delaware, the marriage
taking place in Philadelphia (author&rsquo;s personal information from
Mr Allen Ross, son of John Ross; see also Meredith, &ldquo;The
Cherokees,&rdquo; in the Five Civilized Tribes, Extra Bulletin Eleventh
Census, 1894.) Cooweescoowee district of the Cherokee Nation west has
been named in his honor. The following biographic facts are taken from
the panegyric in his honor, passed by the national council of the
Cherokee, on hearing of his death, &ldquo;as feebly expressive of the
loss they have sustained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Ross was born October 3, 1790, and died in the city of
Washington, August 1, 1866, in the seventy-sixth year of his age. His
official career began in 1809, when he was intrusted by Agent Return
Meigs with an important mission to the Arkansas Cherokee. From that
time until the close of his life, with the exception of two or three
years in the earlier part, he was in the constant service of his
people, &ldquo;furnishing an instance of confidence on their part and
fidelity on his which has never been surpassed in the annals of
history.&rdquo; In the war of 1813&ndash;14 against the Creeks he was
adjutant of the Cherokee regiment which cooperated with General
Jackson, and was present at the battle of the Horseshoe, where the
Cherokee, under Colonel Morgan, of Tennessee, rendered distinguished
service. In 1817 he was elected a member of the national committee of
the Cherokee council. The first duty assigned him was to prepare a
reply to the United States commissioners who were present for the
purpose of negotiating with the Cherokee for their lands east of the
Mississippi, in firm resistance to which he was destined, a few years
later, to test the power of truth and to attain a reputation of no
ordinary character. In 1819, October 26, his name first appears on the
statute book of the Cherokee Nation as president of the national
committee, and is attached to an ordinance which looked to the
improvement of the Cherokee people, providing for the introduction into
the Nation of schoolmasters, blacksmiths, mechanics, and others. He
continued to occupy that position till 1826. In 1827 he was associate
chief with William Hicks, and president of the convention which adopted
the constitution of that year. That constitution, it is believed, is
the first effort at a regular government, with distinct branches and
powers defined, ever made and carried into effect by any of the Indians
of North America. From 1828 until the removal west, he was principal
chief of the eastern Cherokee, and from 1839 to the time of his death,
principal chief of the united Cherokee Nation.</p>
<p>In regard to the long contest which culminated in the Removal, the
resolutions declare that &ldquo;The Cherokees, with John Ross at their
head, alone with their treaties, achieved a recognition of their
rights, but they were powerless to enforce <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>them. They were compelled to yield, but not
until the struggle had developed the highest qualities of patience,
fortitude, and tenacity of right and purpose on their part, as well as
that of their chief. The same may be said of their course after their
removal to this country, and which resulted in the reunion of the
eastern and western Cherokees as one people and in the adoption of the
present constitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the events of the civil war and the official attempt to
depose Ross from his authority, they state that these occurrences, with
many others in their trying history as a people, are confidently
committed to the future page of the historian. &ldquo;It is enough to
know that the treaty negotiated at Washington in 1866 bore the full and
just recognition of John Ross&rsquo; name as principal chief of the
Cherokee nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The summing up of the panegyric is a splendid tribute to a splendid
manhood:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed with a fine constitution and a vigorous mind, John
Ross had the physical ability to follow the path of duty wherever it
led. No danger appalled him. He never faltered in supporting what he
believed to be right, but clung to it with a steadiness of purpose
which alone could have sprung from the clearest convictions of
rectitude. He never sacrificed the interests of his nation to
expediency. He never lost sight of the welfare of the people. For them
he labored daily for a long life, and upon them he bestowed his last
expressed thoughts. A friend of law, he obeyed it; a friend of
education, he faithfully encouraged schools throughout the country, and
spent liberally his means in conferring it upon others. Given to
hospitality, none ever hungered around his door. A professor of the
Christian religion, he practiced its precepts. His works are
inseparable from the history of the Cherokee people for nearly half a
century, while his example in the daily walks of life will linger in
the future and whisper words of hope, temperance, and charity in the
years of posterity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Resolutions were also passed for bringing his body from Washington
at the expense of the Cherokee Nation and providing for suitable
obsequies, in order &ldquo;that his remains should rest among those he
so long served&rdquo; (Resolutions in honor of John Ross, in Laws of
the Cherokee Nation, 1869).</p>
<p>(47) <span class="sc">The Ketoowah Society</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb156" class="pageref">156</a>): This Cherokee secret society, which
has recently achieved some newspaper prominence by its championship of
Cherokee autonomy, derives its name&mdash;properly
K&#301;tu&prime;hw&#259;, but commonly spelled Ketoowah in English
print&mdash;from the ancient town in the old Nation which formed the
nucleus of the most conservative element of the tribe and sometimes
gave a name to the Nation itself (see
<i>K&#301;tu&prime;hwag&#301;</i>, under Tribal Synonyms). A strong
band of comradeship, if not a regular society organization, appears to
have existed among the warriors and leading men of the various
settlements of the Kituhwa district from a remote period, so that the
name is even now used in councils as indicative of genuine Cherokee
feeling in its highest patriotic form. When, some years ago, delegates
from the western Nation visited the East Cherokee to invite them to
join their more prosperous brethren beyond the Mississippi, the speaker
for the delegates expressed their fraternal feeling for their separated
kinsmen by saying in his opening speech, &ldquo;We are all Kituhwa
people&rdquo; (Ani&prime;-K&#301;tu&prime;hwag&#301;). The Ketoowah
society in the Cherokee Nation west was organized shortly before the
civil war by John B. Jones, son of the missionary, Evan Jones, and an
adopted citizen of the Nation, as a secret society for the ostensible
purpose of cultivating a national feeling among the full-bloods, in
opposition to the innovating tendencies of the mixed-blood element. The
real purpose was to counteract the influence of the &ldquo;Blue
Lodge&rdquo; and other secret secessionist organizations among the
wealthier slave-holding classes, made up chiefly of mixed-bloods and
whites. It extended to the Creeks, and its members in both tribes
rendered good service to the Union cause throughout the war. They were
frequently known as &ldquo;Pin Indians,&rdquo; for a reason explained
below. Since the close of the great struggle the society has
distinguished itself by its determined opposition <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>to
every scheme looking to the curtailment or destruction of Cherokee
national self-government.</p>
<p>The following account of the society was written shortly after the
close of the civil war:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Cherokees who were loyal to the Union combined in a
secret organization for self-protection, assuming the designation of
the Ketoowha society, which name was soon merged in that of
&ldquo;Pins.&rdquo; The Pins were so styled because of a peculiar
manner they adopted of wearing a pin. The symbol was discovered by
their enemies, who applied the term in derision; but it was accepted by
this loyal league, and has almost superseded the designation which its
members first assumed. The Pin organization originated among the
members of the Baptist congregation at Peavine, Going-snake district,
in the Cherokee nation. In a short time the society counted nearly
three thousand members, and had commenced proselytizing the Creeks,
when the rebellion, against which it was arming, preventing its further
extension, the poor Creeks having been driven into Kansas by the rebels
of the Golden Circle. During the war the Pins rendered services to the
Union cause in many bloody encounters, as has been acknowledged by our
generals. It was distinctly an anti-slavery organization. The
slave-holding Cherokees, who constituted the wealthy and more
intelligent class, naturally allied themselves with the South, while
loyal Cherokees became more and more opposed to slavery. This was shown
very clearly when the loyalists first met in convention, in February,
1863. They not only abolished slavery unconditionally and forever,
before any slave state made a movement toward emancipation, but made
any attempts at enslaving a grave misdemeanor.</p>
<p>The secret signs of the Pins were a peculiar way of touching the hat
as a salutation, particularly when they were too far apart for
recognition in other ways. They had a peculiar mode of taking hold of
the lapel of the coat, first drawing it away from the body, and then
giving it a motion as though wrapping it around the heart. During the
war a portion of them were forced into the rebellion, but quickly
rebelled against General Cooper, who was placed over them, and when
they fought against that general, at Bird Creek, they wore a bit of
corn-husk, split into strips, tied in their hair. In the night when two
Pins met, and one asked the other, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; the reply
or pass was, &lsquo;Tahlequah&mdash;who are you?&rsquo; The response
was, &lsquo;I am Ketoowha&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;&mdash;Dr D.

<p>(48) <span class="sc">Farewell address of Lloyd Welch</span> (p.
<a href="#pb175" class="pageref">175</a>): In the sad and eventful
history of the Cherokee their gifted leaders, frequently of white
ancestry, have oftentimes spoken to the world with eloquent words of
appeal, of protest, or of acknowledgment, but never more eloquently
than in the last farewell of Chief Lloyd Welch to the eastern band, as
he felt the end draw near (leaflet, MacGowan, Chattanooga [n. d.,
1880]):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first address">&ldquo;<i>To the Chairman and Council of the
Eastern Band of Cherokees</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Brothers: It becomes my imperative duty to bid you an
affectionate farewell, and resign into your hands the trust you so
generously confided to my keeping, principal chief of the Eastern Band.
It is with great solicitude and anxiety for your welfare that I am
constrained to take this course. But the inexorable laws of nature, and
the rapid decline of my health, admonish me that soon, very soon, I
will have passed from earth, my body consigned to the tomb, my spirit
to God who gave it, in that happy home in the beyond, where there is no
sickness, no sorrow, no pain, no death, but one eternal joy and
happiness forever more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only regret that I feel for thus being so soon called
from among you, at the meridian of manhood, when hope is sweet, is the
great anxiety I have to serve and benefit my race. For this I have
studied and labored for the past ten years of my life, to secure to my
brothers equal justice from their brothers of the west and the United
States, and that you would no longer be hewers of wood and drawers of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>water, but assume that proud position among the
civilized nations of the earth intended by the Creator that we should
occupy, and which in the near future you will take or be exterminated.
When you become educated, as a natural consequence you will become more
intelligent, sober, industrious, and prosperous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been the aim of my life, the chief object, to serve my
race faithfully, honestly, and to the best of my ability. How well I
have succeeded I will leave to history and your magnanimity to decide,
trusting an all-wise and just God to guide and protect you in the
future, as He will do all things well. We may fail when on earth to see
the goodness and wisdom of God in removing from us our best and most
useful men, but when we have crossed over on the other shore to our
happy and eternal home in the far beyond then our eyes will be opened
and we will be enabled to see and realize the goodness and mercy of God
in thus afflicting us while here on earth, and will be enabled more
fully to praise God, from whom all blessings come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that when you come to select one from among you to
take the responsible position of principal chief of your band you will
lay aside all personal considerations and select one in every respect
competent, without stain on his fair fame, a pure, noble, honest,
man&mdash;one who loves God and all that is pure&mdash;with intellect
sufficient to know your rights, independence and nerve to defend them.
Should you be thus fortunate in making your choice, all will be well.
It has been truthfully said that &lsquo;when the righteous rule the
people rejoice, but when the wicked rule the people mourn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied that you have among you many who are fully
competent of the task. If I was satisfied it was your wish and for the
good of my brothers I might mention some of them, but think it best to
leave you in the hands of an all-wise God, who does all things right,
to guide and direct you aright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, my brothers, in taking perhaps my last farewell on
earth I do pray God that you may so conduct yourselves while here on
earth that when the last sad rite is performed by loved friends we may
compose one unbroken family above in that celestial city from whose
bourne no traveler has ever returned to describe the beauty, grandeur,
and happiness of the heaven prepared for the faithful by God himself
beyond the sky. And again, my brothers, permit me to bid you a fond,
but perhaps a last, farewell on earth, until we meet again where
parting is never known and friends meet to part no more forever.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>(49) <span class="sc">Status of eastern band</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb180" class="pageref">180</a>): For some reason all authorities who
have hitherto discussed the status of the eastern band of Cherokee seem
to have been entirely unaware of the enactment of the supplementary
articles to the treaty of New Echota, by which all preemption and
reservation rights granted under the twelfth article were canceled.
Thus, in the Cherokee case of &ldquo;The United States <i>et al</i>
against D. T. Boyd <i>et al</i>,&rdquo; we find the United States
circuit judge quoting the twelfth article in its original form as a
basis for argument, while his associate judge says: &ldquo;Their
forefathers availed themselves of a provision in the treaty of New
Echota and remained in the state of North Carolina,&rdquo; etc. (Report
of Indian Commissioner for 1895, pp. 633&ndash;635, 1896). The truth is
that the treaty as ratified with its supplementary articles canceled
the residence right of every Cherokee east of the Mississippi, and it
was not until thirty years afterwards that North Carolina finally gave
assurance that the eastern band would be permitted to remain within her
borders.</p>
<p>The twelfth article of the new Echota treaty of December 29, 1835,
provides for a pro rata apportionment to such Cherokee as desire to
remain in the East, and continues: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228"
href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>&ldquo;Such heads of Cherokee
families as are desirous to reside within the states of North Carolina,
Tennessee, and Alabama, subject to the laws of the same, and who are
qualified or calculated to become useful citizens, shall be entitled,
on the certificate of the commissioners, to a preemption right to one
hundred and sixty acres of land, or one quarter section, at the minimum
Congress price, so as to include the present buildings or improvements
of those who now reside there; and such as do not live there at present
shall be permitted to locate within two years any lands not already
occupied by persons entitled to preemption privilege under this
treaty,&rdquo; etc. Article 13 defines terms with reference to
individual reservations granted under former treaties. The preamble to
the supplementary articles agreed upon on March 1, 1836, recites that,
&ldquo;Whereas the President of the United States has expressed his
determination not to allow any preemptions or reservations, his desire
being that the whole Cherokee people should remove together and
establish themselves in the country provided for them west of the
Mississippi river (article 1): It is therefore agreed that all
preemption rights and reservations provided for in articles 12 and 13
shall be, and are hereby, relinquished and declared void.&rdquo; The
treaty, in this shape, was ratified on May 23, 1836 (see Indian
Treaties, pp. 633&ndash;648, 1837).</p>

"Source: III">IV</span>&mdash;STORIES AND STORY TELLERS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cherokee myths may be roughly classified as sacred
myths, animal stories, local legends, and historical traditions. To the
first class belong the genesis stories, dealing with the creation of
the world, the nature of the heavenly bodies and elemental forces, the
origin of life and death, the spirit world and the invisible beings,
the ancient monsters, and the hero-gods. It is almost certain that most
of the myths of this class are but disjointed fragments of an original
complete genesis and migration legend, which is now lost. With nearly
every tribe that has been studied we find such a sacred legend,
preserved by the priests of the tradition, who alone are privileged to
recite and explain it, and dealing with the origin and wanderings of
the people from the beginning of the world to the final settlement of
the tribe in its home territory. Among the best examples of such
genesis traditions are those recorded in the Walam Olum of the
Delawares and Matthews&rsquo; Navaho Origin Legend. Others may be found
in Cusick&rsquo;s History of the Six Nations, Gatschet&rsquo;s Creek
Migration Legend, and the author&rsquo;s Jicarilla Genesis.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e7788src" href="#xd25e7788" name="xd25e7788src">1</a>
The Cheyenne, Arapaho, and other plains tribes are known to have
similar genesis myths.</p>
<p>The former existence of such a national legend among the Cherokee is
confirmed by Haywood, writing in 1823, who states on information
obtained from a principal man in the tribe that they had once a long
oration, then nearly forgotten, which recounted the history of their
wanderings from the time when they had been first placed upon the earth
by some superior power from above. Up to about the middle of the last
century this tradition was still recited at the annual Green-corn
dance.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7796src" href="#xd25e7796" name=
"xd25e7796src">2</a> Unlike most Indians the Cherokee are not
conservative, and even before the Revolution had so far lost their
primitive customs from contact with the whites that Adair, in 1775,
calls them a nest of apostate hornets who for more than thirty years
had been fast degenerating.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7802src" href=
"#xd25e7802" name="xd25e7802src">3</a> Whatever it may have been, their
national legend is now lost forever. The secret organizations that must
have existed formerly among the priesthood have also disappeared, and
each man now works independently according to his individual gifts and
knowledge.</p>
<p>The sacred myths were not for every one, but only those might hear
who observed the proper form and ceremony. When John Ax and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>other old men were boys, now some eighty years
ago, the myth-keepers and priests were accustomed to meet together at
night in the &acirc;s&#301;, or low-built log sleeping house, to recite
the traditions and discuss their secret knowledge. At times those who
desired instruction from an adept in the sacred lore of the tribe met
him by appointment in the &acirc;s&#301;, where they sat up all night
talking, with only the light of a small fire burning in the middle of
the floor. At daybreak the whole party went down to the running stream,
where the pupils or hearers of the myths stripped themselves, and were
scratched upon their naked skin with a bone-tooth comb in the hands of
the priest, after which they waded out, facing the rising sun, and
dipped seven times under the water, while the priest recited prayers
upon the bank. This purificatory rite, observed more than a century ago
by Adair, is also a part of the ceremonial of the ballplay, the
Green-corn dance, and, in fact, every important ritual performance.
Before beginning one of the stories of the sacred class the informant
would sometimes suggest jokingly that the author first submit to being
scratched and &ldquo;go to water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a special privilege a boy was sometimes admitted to the
&acirc;s&#301; on such occasions, to tend the fire, and thus had the
opportunity to listen to the stories and learn something of the secret
rites. In this way John Ax gained much of his knowledge, although he
does not claim to be an adept. As he describes it, the fire intended to
heat the room&mdash;for the nights are cold in the Cherokee
mountains&mdash;was built upon the ground in the center of the small
house, which was not high enough to permit a standing position, while
the occupants sat in a circle around it. In front of the fire was
placed a large flat rock, and near it a pile of pine knots or splints.
When the fire had burned down to a bed of coals, the boy lighted one or
two of the pine knots and laid them upon the rock, where they blazed
with a bright light until nearly consumed, when others were laid upon
them, and so on until daybreak.</p>
<p>Sometimes the pine splints were set up crosswise, thus,
&times;&times;&times;&times;, in a circle around the fire, with a break
at the eastern side. They were then lighted from one end and burned
gradually around the circle, fresh splints being set up behind as those
in front were consumed. Lawson describes this identical custom as
witnessed at a dance among the Waxhaw, on Catawba river, in 1701:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Now, to return to our state house, whither we were
invited by the grandees. As soon as we came into it, they placed our
Englishmen near the king, it being my fortune to sit next him, having
his great general or war captain on my other hand. The house is as dark
as a dungeon, and as hot as one of the Dutch stoves in Holland. They
had made a circular fire of split canes in the middle of the house, it
was one man&rsquo;s employment to add more split reeds to the one end
as it consumed at the other, there being a small vacancy left to supply
it with fuel.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7816src" href="#xd25e7816"
name="xd25e7816src">4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span></p>
<p>To the second class belong the shorter animal myths, which have lost
whatever sacred character they may once have had, and are told now
merely as humorous explanations of certain animal peculiarities. While
the sacred myths have a constant bearing upon formulistic prayers and
observances, it is only in rare instances that any rite or custom is
based upon an animal myth. Moreover, the sacred myths are known as a
rule only to the professional priests or conjurers, while the shorter
animal stories are more or less familiar to nearly everyone and are
found in almost identical form among Cherokee, Creeks, and other
southern tribes.</p>
<p>The animals of the Cherokee myths, like the traditional hero-gods,
were larger and of more perfect type than their present
representatives. They had chiefs, councils, and townhouses, mingled
with human kind upon terms of perfect equality and spoke the same
language. In some unexplained manner they finally left this lower world
and ascended to Gal&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;l&#259;t&#301;, the world
above, where they still exist. The removal was not simultaneous, but
each animal chose his own time. The animals that we know, small in size
and poor in intellect, came upon the earth later, and are not the
descendants of the mythic animals, but only weak imitations. In one or
two special cases, however, the present creature is the descendant of a
former monster. Trees and plants also were alive and could talk in the
old days, and had their place in council, but do not figure prominently
in the myths.</p>
<p>Each animal had his appointed station and duty. Thus, the
Wal&acirc;&prime;s&#301; frog was the marshal and leader in the
council, while the Rabbit was the messenger to carry all public
announcements, and usually led the dance besides. He was also the great
trickster and mischief maker, a character which he bears in eastern and
southern Indian myth generally, as well as in the southern negro
stories. The bear figures as having been originally a man, with human
form and nature.</p>
<p>As with other tribes and countries, almost every prominent rock and
mountain, every deep bend in the river, in the old Cherokee country has
its accompanying legend. It may be a little story that can be told in a
paragraph, to account for some natural feature, or it may be one
chapter of a myth that has its sequel in a mountain a hundred miles
away. As is usual when a people has lived for a long time in the same
country, nearly every important myth is localized, thus assuming more
definite character.</p>
<p>There is the usual number of anecdotes and stories of personal
adventure, some of them irredeemably vulgar, but historical traditions
are strangely wanting. The authentic records of unlettered peoples are
short at best, seldom going back much farther than the memories of
their oldest men; and although the Cherokee have been the most
important of the southern tribes, making wars and treaties for three
centuries with Spanish, English, French, and Americans, Iroquois,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>Shawano, Catawba, and Creeks, there is little
evidence of the fact in their traditions. This condition may be due in
part to the temper of the Cherokee mind, which, as has been already
stated, is accustomed to look forward to new things rather than to
dwell upon the past. The first Cherokee war, with its stories of
&Acirc;ganst&acirc;&prime;ta and
&#258;t&#259;-g&ucirc;l&prime;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;, is absolutely
forgotten. Of the long Revolutionary struggle they have hardly a
recollection, although they were constantly fighting throughout the
whole period and for several years after, and at one time were brought
to the verge of ruin by four concerted expeditions, which ravaged their
country simultaneously from different directions and destroyed almost
every one of their towns. Even the Creek war, in which many of their
warriors took a prominent part, was already nearly forgotten some years
ago. Beyond a few stories of encounters with the Shawano and Iroquois
there is hardly anything that can be called history until well within
the present century.</p>
<p>With some tribes the winter season and the night are the time for
telling stories, but to the Cherokee all times are alike. As our
grandmothers begin, &ldquo;Once upon a time,&rdquo; so the Cherokee
story-teller introduces his narrative by saying: &ldquo;This is what
the old men told me when I was a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not all tell the same stories, for in tribal lore, as in all other
sorts of knowledge, we find specialists. Some common minds take note
only of common things&mdash;little stories of the rabbit, the terrapin,
and the others, told to point a joke or amuse a child. Others dwell
upon the wonderful and
supernatural&mdash;Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;,
Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301;, and the Thunderers&mdash;and those sacred
things to be told only with prayer and purification. Then, again, there
are still a few old warriors who live in the memory of heroic days when
there were wars with the Seneca and the Shawano, and these men are the
historians of the tribe and the conservators of its antiquities.</p>
<p>The question of the origin of myths is one which affords abundant
opportunity for ingenious theories in the absence of any possibility of
proof. Those of the Cherokee are too far broken down ever to be woven
together again into any long-connected origin legend, such as we find
with some tribes, although a few still exhibit a certain sequence which
indicates that they once formed component parts of a cycle. From the
prominence of the rabbit in the animal stories, as well as in those
found among the southern negroes, an effort has been made to establish
for them a negro origin, regardless of the fact that the
rabbit&mdash;the Great White Rabbit&mdash;is the hero-god, trickster,
and wonder-worker of all the tribes east of the Mississippi from Hudson
bay to the Gulf. In European folklore also the rabbit is regarded as
something uncanny and half-supernatural, and even in far-off Korea he
is the central figure in the animal myths. Just why this should be so
is a question that may be left to the theorist to decide. Among the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>Algonquian tribes the name, <i>wabos</i>, seems
to have been confounded with that of the dawn, <i>waban</i>, so that
the Great White Rabbit is really the incarnation of the eastern dawn
that brings light and life and drives away the dark shadows which have
held the world in chains. The animal itself seems to be regarded by the
Indians as the fitting type of defenseless weakness protected and made
safe by constantly alert vigilance, and with a disposition, moreover,
for turning up at unexpected moments. The same characteristics would
appeal as strongly to the primitive mind of the negro. The very
expression which Harris puts into the mouth of Uncle Remus, &ldquo;In
dem days Brer Rabbit en his fambly wuz at the head er de gang
w&rsquo;en enny racket wus en hand,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e7847src" href="#xd25e7847" name="xd25e7847src">5</a> was
paraphrased in the Cherokee language by Suyeta in introducing his first
rabbit story: &ldquo;<i>Tsi&prime;stu
wuliga&prime;n&#259;t&ucirc;t&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;
une&prime;guts&#259;t&ucirc;&prime; gese&prime;&#301;</i>&mdash;the
Rabbit was the leader of them all in mischief.&rdquo; The expression
struck the author so forcibly that the words were recorded as
spoken.</p>
<p>In regard to the contact between the two races, by which such
stories could be borrowed from one by the other, it is not commonly
known that in all the southern colonies Indian slaves were bought and
sold and kept in servitude and worked in the fields side by side with
negroes up to the time of the Revolution. Not to go back to the Spanish
period, when such things were the order of the day, we find the
Cherokee as early as 1693 complaining that their people were being
kidnaped by slave hunters. Hundreds of captured Tuscarora and nearly
the whole tribe of the Appalachee were distributed as slaves among the
Carolina colonists in the early part of the eighteenth century, while
the Natchez and others shared a similar fate in Louisiana, and as late
at least as 1776 Cherokee prisoners of war were still sold to the
highest bidder for the same purpose. At one time it was charged against
the governor of South Carolina that he was provoking a general Indian
war by his encouragement of slave hunts. Furthermore, as the coast
tribes dwindled they were compelled to associate and intermarry with
the negroes until they finally lost their identity and were classed
with that race, so that a considerable proportion of the blood of the
southern negroes is unquestionably Indian.</p>
<p>The negro, with his genius for imitation and his love for stories,
especially of the comic variety, must undoubtedly have absorbed much
from the Indian in this way, while on the other hand the Indian, with
his pride of conservatism and his contempt for a subject race, would
have taken but little from the negro, and that little could not easily
have found its way back to the free tribes. Some of these animal
stories are common to widely separated tribes among whom there can be
no suspicion of negro influences. Thus the famous &ldquo;tar
baby&rdquo; story has variants, not only among the Cherokee, but also
in New <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>Mexico, Washington, and southern
Alaska&mdash;wherever, in fact, the pi&ntilde;on or the pine supplies
enough gum to be molded into a ball for Indian uses&mdash;while the
incident of the Rabbit dining the Bear is found with nearly every tribe
from Nova Scotia to the Pacific. The idea that such stories are
necessarily of negro origin is due largely to the common but mistaken
notion that the Indian has no sense of humor.</p>
<p>In many cases it is not necessary to assume borrowing from either
side, the myths being such as would naturally spring up in any part of
the world among primitive people accustomed to observe the
characteristics of animals, which their religious system regarded as
differing in no essential from human kind, save only in outward form.
Thus in Europe and America the terrapin has been accepted as the type
of plodding slowness, while the rabbit, with his sudden dash, or the
deer with his bounding stride, is the type of speed. What more natural
than that the story-teller should set one to race against the other,
with the victory in favor of the patient striver against the
self-confident boaster? The idea of a hungry wolf or other beast of
prey luring his victims by the promise of a new song or dance, during
which they must close their eyes, is also one that would easily occur
among any primitive people whose chief pastime is dancing.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e7864src" href="#xd25e7864" name=
"xd25e7864src">6</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, such a conception as that of Flint and the Rabbit
could only be the outgrowth of a special cosmogonic theology, though
now indeed broken and degraded, and it is probable that many myths told
now only for amusement are really worn down fragments of ancient sacred
traditions. Thus the story just noted appears in a different dress
among the Iroquois as a part of their great creation myth. The Cherokee
being a detached tribe of the Iroquois, we may expect to find among the
latter, if it be not already too late, the explanation and more perfect
statement of some things which are obscure in the Cherokee myths. It
must not be forgotten, however, that the Indian, like other men, does
some things for simple amusement, and it is useless to look for occult
meanings where none exist.</p>
<p>Except as to the local traditions and a few others which are
obviously the direct outgrowth of Cherokee conditions, it is impossible
to fix a definite starting point for the myths. It would be unwise to
assert that even the majority of them originated within the tribe. The
Cherokee have strains of Creek, Catawba, Uchee, Natchez, Iroquois,
Osage, and Shawano blood, and such admixture implies contact more or
less intimate and continued. Indians are great wanderers, and a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>myth can travel as far as a redstone pipe or a
string of wampum. It was customary, as it still is to a limited extent
in the West, for large parties, sometimes even a whole band or village,
to make long visits to other tribes, dancing, feasting, trading, and
exchanging stories with their friends for weeks or months at a time,
with the expectation that their hosts would return the visit within the
next summer. Regular trade routes crossed the continent from east to
west and from north to south, and when the subject has been fully
investigated it will be found that this intertribal commerce was as
constant and well recognized a part of Indian life as is our own
railroad traffic today. The very existence of a trade jargon or a sign
language is proof of intertribal relations over wide areas. Their
political alliances also were often far-reaching, for Pontiac welded
into a warlike confederacy all the tribes from the Atlantic border to
the head of the Mississippi, while the emissaries of the Shawano
prophet carried the story of his revelations throughout the whole
region from the Florida coast to the Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>In view of these facts it is as useless to attempt to trace the
origin of every myth as to claim a Cherokee authorship for them all.
From what we know of the character of the Shawano, their tendency
toward the ceremonial and the mystic, and their close relations with
the Cherokee, it may be inferred that some of the myths originated with
that tribe. We should naturally expect also to find close
correspondence with the myths of the Creeks and other southern tribes
within the former area of the Mobilian trade language. The localization
at home of all the more important myths indicates a long residence in
the country. As the majority of those here given belong to the half
dozen counties still familiar to the East Cherokee, we may guess how
many attached to the ancient territory of the tribe are now
irrecoverably lost.</p>
<p>Contact with the white race seems to have produced very little
impression on the tribal mythology, and not more than three or four
stories current among the Cherokee can be assigned to a Caucasian
source. These have not been reproduced here, for the reason that they
are plainly European, and the author has chosen not to follow the
example of some collectors who have assumed that every tale told in an
<span class="corr" id="xd25e7889" title="Source: Indina">Indian</span>
language is necessarily an Indian story. Scores recorded in collections
from the North and West are nothing more than variants from the
celebrated Hausm&auml;rchen, as told by French trappers and voyageurs
to their Indian campmates and halfbreed children. It might perhaps be
thought that missionary influence would be evident in the genesis
tradition, but such is not the case. The Bible story kills the Indian
tradition, and there is no amalgamation. It is hardly necessary to say
that stories of a great fish which swallows a man and of a great flood
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>which destroys a people are found the world
over. The supposed Cherokee hero-god, W&acirc;si, described by one
writer as so remarkably resembling the great Hebrew lawgiver is in fact
that great teacher himself, W&acirc;si being the Cherokee approximate
for Moses, and the good missionary who first recorded the story was
simply listening to a chapter taken by his convert from the Cherokee
testament. The whole primitive pantheon of the Cherokee is still
preserved in their sacred formulas.</p>
<p>As compared with those from some other tribes the Cherokee myths are
clean. For picturesque imagination and wealth of detail they rank high,
and some of the wonder stories may challenge those of Europe and India.
The numerous parallels furnished will serve to indicate their relation
to the general Indian system. Unless otherwise noted, every myth here
given has been obtained directly from the Indians, and in nearly every
case has been verified from several sources.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I know not how the truth may be,</p>
<p class="line">I tell the tale as &rsquo;twas told to me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">First and chief in the list of story tellers comes
A&#699;y&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;in&#301;, &ldquo;Swimmer,&rdquo; from
whom nearly three-fourths of the whole number were originally obtained,
together with nearly as large a proportion of the whole body of
Cherokee material now in possession of the author. The collection could
not have been made without his help, and now that he is gone it can
never be duplicated. Born about 1835, shortly before the Removal, he
grew up under the instruction of masters to be a priest, doctor, and
keeper of tradition, so that he was recognized as an authority
throughout the band and by such a competent outside judge as Colonel
Thomas. He served through the war as second sergeant of the Cherokee
Company A, Sixty-ninth North Carolina Confederate Infantry, Thomas
Legion. He was prominent in the local affairs of the band, and no
Green-corn dance, ballplay, or other tribal function was ever
considered complete without his presence and active assistance. A
genuine aboriginal antiquarian and patriot, proud of his people and
their ancient system, he took delight in recording in his native
alphabet the songs and sacred formulas of priests and dancers and the
names of medicinal plants and the prescriptions with which they were
compounded, while his mind was a storehouse of Indian tradition. To a
happy descriptive style he added a musical voice for the songs and a
peculiar faculty for imitating the characteristic cry of bird or beast,
so that to listen to one of his recitals was often a pleasure in
itself, even to one who understood not a word of the language. He spoke
no English, and to the day of his death clung to the moccasin and
turban, together with the rattle, his badge of authority. He died in
March, 1899, aged about sixty-five, and was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>buried like a true Cherokee on the slope of a
forest-clad mountain. Peace to his ashes and sorrow for his going, for
with him perished half the tradition of a people.</p>
<p>Next in order comes the name of
It&#259;g&ucirc;&prime;n&#259;h&#301;, better known as John Ax, born
about 1800 and now consequently just touching the century mark, being
the oldest man of the band. He has a distinct recollection of the Creek
war, at which time he was about twelve years of age, and was already
married and a father when the lands east of Nantahala were sold by the
treaty of 1819. Although not a professional priest or doctor, he was
recognized, before age had dulled his faculties, as an authority upon
all relating to tribal custom, and was an expert in the making of
rattles, wands, and other ceremonial paraphernalia. Of a poetic and
imaginative temperament, he cared most for the wonder stories, of the
giant Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;, of the great Uktena or of the
invisible spirit people, but he had also a keen appreciation of the
humorous animal stories. He speaks no English, and with his erect spare
figure and piercing eye is a fine specimen of the old-time Indian.
Notwithstanding his great age he walked without other assistance than
his stick to the last ball game, where he watched every run with the
closest interest, and would have attended the dance the night before
but for the interposition of friends.</p>
<p>Suyeta, &ldquo;The Chosen One,&rdquo; who preaches regularly as a
Baptist minister to an Indian congregation, does not deal much with the
Indian supernatural, perhaps through deference to his clerical
obligations, but has a good memory and liking for rabbit stories and
others of the same class. He served in the Confederate army during the
war as fourth sergeant in Company A, of the Sixty-ninth North Carolina,
and is now a well-preserved man of about sixty-two. He speaks no
English, but by an ingenious system of his own has learned to use a
concordance for verifying references in his Cherokee bible. He is also
a first-class carpenter and mason.</p>
<p>Another principal informant was Ta&prime;gw&#259;dih&#301;&prime;,
&ldquo;Catawba-killer,&rdquo; of Cheowa, who died a few years ago, aged
about seventy. He was a doctor and made no claim to special knowledge
of myths or ceremonials, but was able to furnish several valuable
stories, besides confirmatory evidence for a large number obtained from
other sources.</p>
<p>Besides these may be named, among the East Cherokee, the late Chief
N. J. Smith; Sal&acirc;&prime;l&#301;, mentioned elsewhere, who died
about 1895; Ts&#277;sa&prime;n&#301; or Jessan, who also served in the
war; Ay&acirc;&prime;sta, one of the principal conservatives among the
women; and James and David Blythe, younger men of mixed blood, with an
English education, but inheritors of a large share of Indian lore from
their father, who was a recognized leader of ceremony.</p>
<p>Among informants in the western Cherokee Nation the principal was
James D. Wafford, known to the Indians as
Tsuskw&#259;n&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;n&#259;wa&prime;t&#259;,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>&ldquo;Worn-out-blanket,&rdquo; a mixed-blood
speaking and writing both languages, born in the old Cherokee Nation
near the site of the present Clarkesville, Georgia, in 1806, and dying
when about ninety years of age at his home in the eastern part of the
Cherokee Nation, adjoining the Seneca reservation. The name figures
prominently in the early history of North Carolina and Georgia. His
grandfather, Colonel Wafford, was an officer in the American
Revolutionary army, and shortly after the treaty of Hopewell, in 1785,
established a colony known as &ldquo;Wafford&rsquo;s settlement,&rdquo;
in upper Georgia, on territory which was afterward found to be within
the Indian boundary and was acquired by special treaty purchase in
1804. His name is appended, as witness for the state of Georgia, to the
treaty of Holston, in 1794.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7918src" href=
"#xd25e7918" name="xd25e7918src">7</a> On his mother&rsquo;s side Mr
Wafford was of mixed Cherokee, Natchez, and white blood, she being a
cousin of Sequoya. He was also remotely connected with Cornelius
Dougherty, the first trader established among the Cherokee. In the
course of his long life he filled many positions of trust and honor
among his people. In his youth he attended the mission school at
Valleytown under Reverend Evan Jones, and just before the adoption of
the Cherokee alphabet he finished the translation into phonetic
Cherokee spelling of a Sunday school speller noted in Pilling&rsquo;s
<span class="corr" id="xd25e7921" title=
"Source: Iroquoin">Iroquoian</span> Bibliography. In 1824 he was the
census enumerator for that district of the Cherokee Nation embracing
upper Hiwassee river, in North Carolina, with Nottely and Toccoa in the
adjoining portion of Georgia. His fund of Cherokee geographic
information thus acquired was found to be invaluable. He was one of the
two commanders of the largest detachment of emigrants at the time of
the removal, and his name appears as a councilor for the western Nation
in the Cherokee Almanac for 1846. When employed by the author at
Tahlequah in 1891 his mind was still clear and his memory keen. Being
of practical bent, he was concerned chiefly with tribal history,
geography, linguistics, and every-day life and custom, on all of which
subjects his knowledge was exact and detailed, but there were few myths
for which he was not able to furnish confirmatory testimony. Despite
his education he was a firm believer in the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;, and several of the best legends
connected with them were obtained from him. His death takes from the
Cherokee one of the last connecting links between the present and the
past.</p>

<h4 class="main">1. HOW THE WORLD WAS MADE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The earth is a great island floating in a sea of
water, and suspended at each of the four cardinal points by a cord
hanging down from the sky vault, which is of solid rock. When the world
grows old and worn out, the people will die and the cords will break
and let the earth sink down into the ocean, and all will be water
again. The Indians are afraid of this.</p>
<p>When all was water, the animals were above in
G&#259;l&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;l&#259;t&#301;, beyond the arch; but it
was very much crowded, and they were wanting more room. They wondered
what was below the water, and at last D&acirc;yuni&prime;s&#301;,
&ldquo;Beaver&rsquo;s Grandchild,&rdquo; the little Water-beetle,
offered to go and see if it could learn. It darted in every direction
over the surface of the water, but could find no firm place to rest.
Then it dived to the bottom and came up with some soft mud, which began
to grow and spread on every side until it became the island which we
call the earth. It was afterward fastened to the sky with four cords,
but no one remembers who did this.</p>
<p>At first the earth was flat and very soft and wet. The animals were
anxious to get down, and sent out different birds to see if it was yet
dry, but they found no place to alight and came back again to
G&#259;l&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;l&#259;t&#301;. At last it seemed to be
time, and they sent out the Buzzard and told him to go and make ready
for them. This was the Great Buzzard, the father of all the buzzards we
see now. He flew all over the earth, low down near the ground, and it
was still soft. When he reached the Cherokee country, he was very
tired, and his wings began to flap and strike the ground, and wherever
they struck the earth there was a valley, and where they turned up
again there was a mountain. When the animals above saw this, they were
afraid that the whole world would be mountains, so they called him
back, but the Cherokee country remains full of mountains to this
day.</p>
<p>When the earth was dry and the animals came down, it was still dark,
so they got the sun and set it in a track to go every day across the
island from east to west, just overhead. It was too hot this way, and
Tsiska&prime;g&#301;l&#301;&prime;, the Red Crawfish, had his shell
scorched a bright red, so that his meat was spoiled; and the Cherokee
do not eat it. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240"
name="pb240">240</a>]</span>conjurers put the sun another hand-breadth
higher in the air, but it was still too hot. They raised it another
time, and another, until it was seven handbreadths high and just under
the sky arch. Then it was right, and they left it so. This is why the
conjurers call the highest place G&ucirc;lkw&acirc;&prime;gine
Di&prime;g&#259;l&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;l&#259;tiy&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;,
&ldquo;the seventh height,&rdquo; because it is seven hand-breadths
above the earth. Every day the sun goes along under this arch, and
returns at night on the upper side to the starting place.</p>
<p>There is another world under this, and it is like ours in
everything&mdash;animals, plants, and people&mdash;save that the
seasons are different. The streams that come down from the mountains
are the trails by which we reach this underworld, and the springs at
their heads are the doorways by which we enter it, but to do this one
must fast and go to water and have one of the underground people for a
guide. We know that the seasons in the underworld are different from
ours, because the water in the springs is always warmer in winter and
cooler in summer than the outer air.</p>
<p>When the animals and plants were first made&mdash;we do not know by
whom&mdash;they were told to watch and keep awake for seven nights,
just as young men now fast and keep awake when they pray to their
medicine. They tried to do this, and nearly all were awake through the
first night, but the next night several dropped off to sleep, and the
third night others were asleep, and then others, until, on the seventh
night, of all the animals only the owl, the panther, and one or two
more were still awake. To these were given the power to see and to go
about in the dark, and to make prey of the birds and animals which must
sleep at night. Of the trees only the cedar, the pine, the spruce, the
holly, and the laurel were awake to the end, and to them it was given
to be always green and to be greatest for medicine, but to the others
it was said: &ldquo;Because you have not endured to the end you shall
lose your hair every winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men came after the animals and plants. At first there were only a
brother and sister until he struck her with a fish and told her to
multiply, and so it was. In seven days a child was born to her, and
thereafter every seven days another, and they increased very fast until
there was danger that the world could not keep them. Then it was made
that a woman should have only one child in a year, and it has been so
ever since.</p>

<h4 class="main">2. THE FIRST FIRE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the beginning there was no fire, and the world was
cold, until the Thunders
(Ani&prime;-Hy&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;t&#301;kw&#259;l&acirc;&prime;sk&#301;),
who lived up in G&#259;l&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;l&#259;t&#301;, sent
their lightning and put fire into the bottom of a hollow sycamore tree
which grew on an island. The animals knew it was there, because they
could see the smoke coming out at the top, but they could not get to it
on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>account of the water, so they held a council to
decide what to do. This was a long time ago.</p>
<p>Every animal that could fly or swim was anxious to go after the
fire. The Raven offered, and because he was so large and strong they
thought he could surely do the work, so he was sent first. He flew high
and far across the water and alighted on the sycamore tree, but while
he was wondering what to do next, the heat had scorched all his
feathers black, and he was frightened and came back without the fire.
The little Screech-owl (<i>Wa&prime;huhu&prime;</i>) volunteered to go,
and reached the place safely, but while he was looking down into the
hollow tree a blast of hot air came up and nearly burned out his eyes.
He managed to fly home as best he could, but it was a long time before
he could see well, and his eyes are red to this day. Then the Hooting
Owl (<i>U&prime;guku&prime;</i>) and the Horned Owl
(<i>Tsk&#301;l&#301;&prime;</i>) went, but by the time they got to the
hollow tree the fire was burning so fiercely that the smoke nearly
blinded them, and the ashes carried up by the wind made white rings
about their eyes. They had to come home again without the fire, but
with all their rubbing they were never able to get rid of the white
rings.</p>
<p>Now no more of the birds would venture, and so the little
Uksu&prime;h&#301; snake, the black racer, said he would go through the
water and bring back some fire. He swam across to the island and
crawled through the grass to the tree, and went in by a small hole at
the bottom. The heat and smoke were too much for him, too, and after
dodging about blindly over the hot ashes until he was almost on fire
himself he managed by good luck to get out again at the same hole, but
his body had been scorched black, and he has ever since had the habit
of darting and doubling on his track as if trying to escape from close
quarters. He came back, and the great blacksnake,
G&ucirc;le&prime;g&#301;, &ldquo;The Climber,&rdquo; offered to go for
fire. He swam over to the island and climbed up the tree on the
outside, as the blacksnake always does, but when he put his head down
into the hole the smoke choked him so that he fell into the burning
stump, and before he could climb out again he was as black as the
Uksu&prime;h&#301;.</p>
<p>Now they held another council, for still there was no fire, and the
world was cold, but birds, snakes, and four-footed animals, all had
some excuse for not going, because they were all afraid to venture near
the burning sycamore, until at last K&#259;n&#259;ne&prime;sk&#301;
Amai&prime;y&#277;h&#301; (the Water Spider) said she would go. This is
not the water spider that looks like a mosquito, but the other one,
with black downy hair and red stripes on her body. She can run on top
of the water or dive to the bottom, so there would be no trouble to get
over to the island, but the question was, How could she bring back the
fire? &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage that,&rdquo; said the Water Spider; so
she spun a thread from her body and wove it into a <i>tusti</i> bowl,
which she fastened on her back. Then she crossed over to the island and
through the grass to where the fire was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>still burning. She
put one little coal of fire into her bowl, and came back with it, and
ever since we have had fire, and the Water Spider still keeps her tusti
bowl.</p>

<h4 class="main">3. KANA&prime;T&#300; AND SELU: THE ORIGIN OF GAME AND
CORN</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When I was a boy this is what the old men told me they
had heard when they were boys.</p>
<p>Long years ago, soon after the world was made, a hunter and his wife
lived at Pilot knob with their only child, a little boy. The
father&rsquo;s name was Kana&prime;t&#301; (The Lucky Hunter), and his
wife was called Selu (Corn). No matter when Kana&prime;t&#301; went
into the wood, he never failed to bring back a load of game, which his
wife would cut up and prepare, washing off the blood from the meat in
the river near the house. The little boy used to play down by the river
every day, and one morning the old people thought they heard laughing
and talking in the bushes as though there were two children there. When
the boy came home at night his parents asked him who had been playing
with him all day. &ldquo;He comes out of the water,&rdquo; said the
boy, &ldquo;and he calls himself my elder brother. He says his mother
was cruel to him and threw him into the river.&rdquo; Then they knew
that the strange boy had sprung from the blood of the game which Selu
had washed off at the river&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>Every day when the little boy went out to play the other would join
him, but as he always went back again into the water the old people
never had a chance to see him. At last one evening Kana&prime;t&#301;
said to his son, &ldquo;Tomorrow, when the other boy comes to play, get
him to wrestle with you, and when you have your arms around him hold on
to him and call for us.&rdquo; The boy promised to do as he was told,
so the next day as soon as his playmate appeared he challenged him to a
wrestling match. The other agreed at once, but as soon as they had
their arms around each other, Kana&prime;t&#301;&rsquo;s boy began to
scream for his father. The old folks at once came running down, and as
soon as the Wild Boy saw them he struggled to free himself and cried
out, &ldquo;Let me go; you threw me away!&rdquo; but his brother held
on until the parents reached the spot, when they seized the Wild Boy
and took him home with them. They kept him in the house until they had
tamed him, but he was always wild and artful in his disposition, and
was the leader of his brother in every mischief. It was not long until
the old people discovered that he had magic powers, and they called him
I&prime;n&#259;ge-ut&#259;s&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;h&#301;
(He-who-grew-up-wild).</p>
<p>Whenever Kana&prime;t&#301; went into the mountains he always
brought back a fat buck or doe, or maybe a couple of turkeys. One day
the Wild Boy said to his brother, &ldquo;I wonder where our father gets
all that game; let&rsquo;s follow him next time and find out.&rdquo; A
few days afterward Kana&prime;t&#301; took a bow and some feathers in
his hand and started off <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href=
"#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>toward the west. The boys waited a
little while and then went after him, keeping out of sight until they
saw him go into a swamp where there were a great many of the small
reeds that hunters use to make arrowshafts. Then the Wild Boy changed
himself into a puff of bird&rsquo;s down, which the wind took up and
carried until it alighted upon Kana&prime;t&#301;&rsquo;s shoulder just
as he entered the swamp, but Kana&prime;t&#301; knew nothing about it.
The old man cut reeds, fitted the feathers to them and made some
arrows, and the Wild Boy&mdash;in his other shape&mdash;thought,
&ldquo;I wonder what those things are for?&rdquo; When
Kana&prime;t&#301; had his arrows finished he came out of the swamp and
went on again. The wind blew the down from his shoulder, and it fell in
the woods, when the Wild Boy took his right shape again and went back
and told his brother what he had seen. Keeping out of sight of their
father, they followed him up the mountain until he stopped at a certain
place and lifted a large rock. At once there ran out a buck, which
Kana&prime;t&#301; shot, and then lifting it upon his back he started
for home again. &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; exclaimed the boys, &ldquo;he keeps
all the deer shut up in that hole, and whenever he wants meat he just
lets one out and kills it with those things he made in the
swamp.&rdquo; They hurried and reached home before their father, who
had the heavy deer to carry, and he never knew that they had
followed.</p>
<p>A few days later the boys went back to the swamp, cut some reeds,
and made seven arrows, and then started up the mountain to where their
father kept the game. When they got to the place, they raised the rock
and a deer came running out. Just as they drew back to shoot it,
another came out, and then another and another, until the boys got
confused and forgot what they were about. In those days all the deer
had their tails hanging down like other animals, but as a buck was
running past the Wild Boy struck its tail with his arrow so that it
pointed upward. The boys thought this good sport, and when the next one
ran past the Wild Boy struck its tail so that it stood straight up, and
his brother struck the next one so hard with his arrow that the
deer&rsquo;s tail was almost curled over his back. The deer carries his
tail this way ever since. The deer came running past until the last one
had come out of the hole and escaped into the forest. Then came droves
of raccoons, rabbits, and all the other four-footed animals&mdash;all
but the bear, because there was no bear then. Last came great flocks of
turkeys, pigeons, and partridges that darkened the air like a cloud and
made such a noise with their wings that Kana&prime;t&#301;, sitting at
home, heard the sound like distant thunder on the mountains and said to
himself, &ldquo;My bad boys have got into trouble; I must go and see
what they are doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he went up the mountain, and when he came to the place where he
kept the game he found the two boys standing by the rock, and all the
birds and animals were gone. Kana&prime;t&#301; was furious, but
without <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>saying a word he went down into the cave and
kicked the covers off four jars in one corner, when out swarmed
bedbugs, fleas, lice, and gnats, and got all over the boys. They
screamed with pain and fright and tried to beat off the insects, but
the thousands of vermin crawled over them and bit and stung them until
both dropped down nearly dead. Kana&prime;t&#301; stood looking on
until he thought they had been punished enough, when he knocked off the
vermin and made the boys a talk. &ldquo;Now, you rascals,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;you have always had plenty to eat and never had to work for
it. Whenever you were hungry all I had to do was to come up here and
get a deer or a turkey and bring it home for your mother to cook; but
now you have let out all the animals, and after this when you want a
deer to eat you will have to hunt all over the woods for it, and then
maybe not find one. Go home now to your mother, while I see if I can
find something to eat for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the boys got home again they were very tired and hungry and
asked their mother for something to eat. &ldquo;There is no
meat,&rdquo; said Selu, &ldquo;but wait a little while and I&rsquo;ll
get you something.&rdquo; So she took a basket and started out to the
storehouse. This storehouse was built upon poles high up from the
ground, to keep it out of the reach of animals, and there was a ladder
to climb up by, and one door, but no other opening. Every day when Selu
got ready to cook the dinner she would go out to the storehouse with a
basket and bring it back full of corn and beans. The boys had never
been inside the storehouse, so wondered where all the corn and beans
could come from, as the house was not a very large one; so as soon as
Selu went out of the door the Wild Boy said to his brother,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see what she does.&rdquo; They ran around and
climbed up at the back of the storehouse and pulled out a piece of clay
from between the logs, so that they could look in. There they saw Selu
standing in the middle of the room with the basket in front of her on
the floor. Leaning over the basket, she rubbed her
stomach&mdash;<i>so</i>&mdash;and the basket was half full of corn.
Then she rubbed under her armpits&mdash;<i>so</i>&mdash;and the basket
was full to the top with beans. The boys looked at each other and said,
&ldquo;This will never do; our mother is a witch. If we eat any of that
it will poison us. We must kill her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the boys came back into the house, she knew their thoughts
before they spoke. &ldquo;So you are going to kill me?&rdquo; said
Selu. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boys, &ldquo;you are a witch.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said their mother, &ldquo;when you have killed me,
clear a large piece of ground in front of the house and drag my body
seven times around the circle. Then drag me seven times over the ground
inside the circle, and stay up all night and watch, and in the morning
you will have plenty of corn.&rdquo; The boys killed her with their
clubs, and cut off her head and put it up on the roof of the house with
her face turned to the west, and told her to look for her husband. Then
they set to work to clear the ground in front of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>house, but instead of clearing the whole piece
they cleared only seven little spots. This is why corn now grows only
in a few places instead of over the whole world. They dragged the body
of Selu around the circle, and wherever her blood fell on the ground
the corn sprang up. But instead of dragging her body seven times across
the ground they dragged it over only twice, which is the reason the
Indians still work their crop but twice. The two brothers sat up and
watched their corn all night, and in the morning it was full grown and
ripe.</p>
<p>When Kana&prime;t&#301; came home at last, he looked around, but
could not see Selu anywhere, and asked the boys where was their mother.
&ldquo;She was a witch, and we killed her,&rdquo; said the boys;
&ldquo;there is her head up there on top of the house.&rdquo; When he
saw his wife&rsquo;s head on the roof, he was very angry, and said,
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stay with you any longer; I am going to the Wolf
people.&rdquo; So he started off, but before he had gone far the Wild
Boy changed himself again to a tuft of down, which fell on
Kana&prime;t&#301;&rsquo;s shoulder. When Kana&prime;t&#301; reached
the settlement of the Wolf people, they were holding a council in the
townhouse. He went in and sat down with the tuft of bird&rsquo;s down
on his shoulder, but he never noticed it. When the Wolf chief asked him
his business, he said: &ldquo;I have two bad boys at home, and I want
you to go in seven days from now and play ball against them.&rdquo;
Although Kana&prime;t&#301; spoke as though he wanted them to play a
game of ball, the Wolves knew that he meant for them to go and kill the
two boys. They promised to go. Then the bird&rsquo;s down blew off from
Kana&prime;t&#301;&rsquo;s shoulder, and the smoke carried it up
through the hole in the roof of the townhouse. When it came down on the
ground outside, the Wild Boy took his right shape again and went home
and told his brother all that he had heard in the townhouse. But when
Kana&prime;t&#301; left the Wolf people he did not return home, but
went on farther.</p>
<p>The boys then began to get ready for the Wolves, and the Wild
Boy&mdash;the magician&mdash;told his brother what to do. They ran
around the house in a wide circle until they had made a trail all
around it excepting on the side from which the Wolves would come, where
they left a small open space. Then they made four large bundles of
arrows and placed them at four different points on the outside of the
circle, after which they hid themselves in the woods and waited for the
Wolves. In a day or two a whole party of Wolves came and surrounded the
house to kill the boys. The Wolves did not notice the trail around the
house, because they came in where the boys had left the opening, but
the moment they went inside the circle the trail changed to a high
brush fence and shut them in. Then the boys on the outside took their
arrows and began shooting them down, and as the Wolves could not jump
over the fence they were all killed, excepting a few that escaped
through the opening into a great swamp close by. The boys ran around
the swamp, and a circle of fire sprang up in their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>tracks and set fire to the grass and bushes and
burned up nearly all the other Wolves. Only two or three got away, and
from these have come all the wolves that are now in the world.</p>
<p>Soon afterward some strangers from a distance, who had heard that
the brothers had a wonderful grain from which they made bread, came to
ask for some, for none but Selu and her family had ever known corn
before. The boys gave them seven grains of corn, which they told them
to plant the next night on their way home, sitting up all night to
watch the corn, which would have seven ripe ears in the morning. These
they were to plant the next night and watch in the same way, and so on
every night until they reached home, when they would have corn enough
to supply the whole people. The strangers lived seven days&rsquo;
journey away. They took the seven grains and watched all through the
darkness until morning, when they saw seven tall stalks, each stalk
bearing a ripened ear. They gathered the ears and went on their way.
The next night they planted all their corn, and guarded it as before
until daybreak, when they found an abundant increase. But the way was
long and the sun was hot, and the people grew tired. On the last night
before reaching home they fell asleep, and in the morning the corn they
had planted had not even sprouted. They brought with them to their
settlement what corn they had left and planted it, and with care and
attention were able to raise a crop. But ever since the corn must be
watched and tended through half the year, which before would grow and
ripen in a night.</p>
<p>As Kana&prime;t&#301; did not return, the boys at last concluded to
go and find him. The Wild Boy took a gaming wheel and rolled it toward
the Darkening land. In a little while the wheel came rolling back, and
the boys knew their father was not there. He rolled it to the south and
to the north, and each time the wheel came back to him, and they knew
their father was not there. Then he rolled it toward the Sunland, and
it did not return. &ldquo;Our father is there,&rdquo; said the Wild
Boy, &ldquo;let us go and find him.&rdquo; So the two brothers set off
toward the east, and after traveling a long time they came upon
Kana&prime;t&#301; walking along with a little dog by his side.
&ldquo;You bad boys,&rdquo; said their father, &ldquo;have you come
here?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;we always
accomplish what we start out to do&mdash;we are men.&rdquo; &ldquo;This
dog overtook me four days ago,&rdquo; then said Kana&prime;t&#301;, but
the boys knew that the dog was the wheel which they had sent after him
to find him. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Kana&prime;t&#301;, &ldquo;as you
have found me, we may as well travel together, but I shall take the
lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon they came to a swamp, and Kana&prime;t&#301; told them there
was something dangerous there and they must keep away from it. He went
on ahead, but as soon as he was out of sight the Wild Boy said to his
brother, &ldquo;Come and let us see what is in the swamp.&rdquo; They
went in together, and in the middle of the swamp they found a large
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>panther asleep. The Wild Boy got out an arrow
and shot the panther in the side of the head. The panther turned his
head and the other boy shot him on that side. He turned his head away
again and the two brothers shot together&mdash;<i>tust, tust, tust!</i>
But the panther was not hurt by the arrows and paid no more attention
to the boys. They came out of the swamp and soon overtook
Kana&prime;t&#301;, waiting for them. &ldquo;Did you find it?&rdquo;
asked Kana&prime;t&#301;. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boys, &ldquo;we
found it, but it never hurt us. We are men.&rdquo; Kana&prime;t&#301;
was surprised, but said nothing, and they went on again.</p>
<p>After a while he turned to them and said, &ldquo;Now you must be
careful. We are coming to a tribe called the
An&#259;da&prime;d&ucirc;&ntilde;t&#259;sk&#301;
(&ldquo;Roasters,&rdquo; i. e., cannibals), and if they get you they
will put you into a pot and feast on you.&rdquo; Then he went on ahead.
Soon the boys came to a tree which had been struck by lightning, and
the Wild Boy directed his brother to gather some of the splinters from
the tree and told him what to do with them. In a little while they came
to the settlement of the cannibals, who, as soon as they saw the boys,
came running out, crying, &ldquo;Good, here are two nice fat strangers.
Now we&rsquo;ll have a grand feast!&rdquo; They caught the boys and
dragged them into the townhouse, and sent word to all the people of the
settlement to come to the feast. They made up a great fire, put water
into a large pot and set it to boiling, and then seized the Wild Boy
and put him down into it. His brother was not in the least frightened
and made no attempt to escape, but quietly knelt down and began putting
the splinters into the fire, as if to make it burn better. When the
cannibals thought the meat was about ready they lifted the pot from the
fire, and that instant a blinding light filled the townhouse, and the
lightning began to dart from one side to the other, striking down the
cannibals until not one of them was left alive. Then the lightning went
up through the smoke-hole, and the next moment there were the two boys
standing outside the townhouse as though nothing had happened. They
went on and soon met Kana&prime;t&#301;, who seemed much surprised to
see them, and said, &ldquo;What! are you here again?&rdquo; &ldquo;O,
yes, we never give up. We are great men!&rdquo; &ldquo;What did the
cannibals do to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;We met them and they brought us to
their townhouse, but they never hurt us.&rdquo; Kana&prime;t&#301; said
nothing more, and they went on.</p>
<p class="tb">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>He soon got out of sight of the boys, but they kept on until they
came to the end of the world, where the sun comes out. The sky was just
coming down when they got there, but they waited until it went up
again, and then they went through and climbed up on the other side.
There they found Kana&prime;t&#301; and Selu sitting together. The old
folk received them kindly and were glad to see them, telling them they
might stay there a while, but then they must go to live where the sun
goes down. The boys stayed with their parents seven days and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>then went on toward the Darkening land, where
they are now. We call them Anisga&prime;ya Tsunsdi&prime; (The Little
Men), and when they talk to each other we hear low rolling thunder in
the west.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>After Kana&prime;t&#301;&rsquo;s boys had let the deer out from the
cave where their father used to keep them, the hunters tramped about in
the woods for a long time without finding any game, so that the people
were very hungry. At last they heard that the Thunder Boys were now
living in the far west, beyond the sun door, and that if they were sent
for they could bring back the game. So they sent messengers for them,
and the boys came and sat down in the middle of the townhouse and began
to sing.</p>
<p>At the first song there was a roaring sound like a strong wind in
the northwest, and it grew louder and nearer as the boys sang on, until
at the seventh song a whole herd of deer, led by a large buck, came out
from the woods. The boys had told the people to be ready with their
bows and arrows, and when the song was ended and all the deer were
close around the townhouse, the hunters shot into them and killed as
many as they needed before the herd could get back into the timber.</p>
<p>Then the Thunder Boys went back to the Darkening land, but before
they left they taught the people the seven songs with which to call up
the deer. It all happened so long ago that the songs are now
forgotten&mdash;all but two, which the hunters still sing whenever they
go after deer.</p>
<div class="div4 variant">

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After the world had been brought up from under the
water, &ldquo;They then made a man and a woman and led them around the
edge of the island. On arriving at the starting place they planted some
corn, and then told the man and woman to go around the way they had
been led. This they did, and on returning they found the corn up and
growing nicely. They were then told to continue the circuit. Each trip
consumed more time. At last the corn was ripe and ready for
use.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Another story is told of how sin came into the world. A man and a
woman reared a large family of children in comfort and plenty, with
very little trouble about providing food for them. Every morning the
father went forth and very soon returned bringing with him a deer, or a
turkey, or some other animal or fowl. At the same time the mother went
out and soon returned with a large basket filled with ears of corn
which she shelled and pounded in a mortar, thus making meal for
bread.</p>
<p>When the children grew up, seeing with what apparent ease food was
provided for them, they talked to each other about it, wondering that
they never saw such things as their parents brought in. At last
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>one proposed to watch when their parents went
out and to follow them.</p>
<p>Accordingly next morning the plan was carried out. Those who
followed the father saw him stop at a short distance from the cabin and
turn over a large stone that appeared to be carelessly leaned against
another. On looking closely they saw an entrance to a large cave, and
in it were many different kinds of animals and birds, such as their
father had sometimes brought in for food. The man standing at the
entrance called a deer, which was lying at some distance and back of
some other animals. It rose immediately as it heard the call and came
close up to him. He picked it up, closed the mouth of the cave, and
returned, not once seeming to suspect what his sons had done.</p>
<p>When the old man was fairly out of sight, his sons, rejoicing how
they had outwitted him, left their hiding place and went to the cave,
saying they would show the old folks that they, too, could bring in
something. They moved the stone away, though it was very heavy and they
were obliged to use all their united strength. When the cave was
opened, the animals, instead of waiting to be picked up, all made a
rush for the entrance, and leaping past the frightened and bewildered
boys, scattered in all directions and disappeared in the wilderness,
while the guilty offenders could do nothing but gaze in <span class=

amazement as they saw them escape. There were animals of all kinds,
large and small&mdash;buffalo, deer, elk, antelope, raccoons, and
squirrels; even catamounts and panthers, wolves and foxes, and many
others, all fleeing together. At the same time birds of every kind were
seen emerging from the opening, all in the same wild confusion as the
quadrupeds&mdash;turkeys, geese, swans, ducks, quails, eagles, hawks,
and owls.</p>
<p>Those who followed the mother saw her enter a small cabin, which
they had never seen before, and close the door. The culprits found a
small crack through which they could peer. They saw the woman place a
basket on the ground and standing over it shake herself vigorously,
jumping up and down, when lo and behold! large ears of corn began to
fall into the basket. When it was well filled she took it up and,
placing it on her head, came out, fastened the door, and prepared their
breakfast as usual. When the meal had been finished in silence the man
spoke to his children, telling them that he was aware of what they had
done; that now he must die and they would be obliged to provide for
themselves. He made bows and arrows for them, then sent them to hunt
for the animals which they had turned loose.</p>
<p>Then the mother told them that as they had found out her secret she
could do nothing more for them; that she would die, and they must drag
her body around over the ground; that wherever her body was dragged
corn would come up. Of this they were to make their bread. She told
them that they must always save some for seed and plant every year.

<h4 class="main">4. ORIGIN OF DISEASE AND MEDICINE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the old days the beasts, birds, fishes, insects,
and plants could all talk, and they and the people lived together in
peace and friendship. But as time went on the people increased so
rapidly that their settlements spread over the whole earth, and the
poor animals found themselves beginning to be cramped for room. This
was bad enough, but to make it worse Man invented bows, knives,
blowguns, spears, and hooks, and began to slaughter the larger animals,
birds, and fishes for their flesh or their skins, while the smaller
creatures, such as the frogs and worms, were crushed and trodden upon
without thought, out of pure carelessness or contempt. So the animals
resolved to consult upon measures for their common safety.</p>
<p>The Bears were the first to meet in council in their townhouse under
Kuw&acirc;&prime;h&#301; mountain, the &ldquo;Mulberry place,&rdquo;
and the old White Bear chief presided. After each in turn had
complained of the way in which Man killed their friends, ate their
flesh, and used their skins for his own purposes, it was decided to
begin war at once against him. Some one asked what weapons Man used to
destroy them. &ldquo;Bows and arrows, of course,&rdquo; cried all the
Bears in chorus. &ldquo;And what are they made of?&rdquo; was the next
question. &ldquo;The bow of wood, and the string of our
entrails,&rdquo; replied one of the Bears. It was then proposed that
they make a bow and some arrows and see if they could not use the same
weapons against Man himself. So one Bear got a nice piece of locust
wood and another sacrificed himself for the good of the rest in order
to furnish a piece of his entrails for the string. But when everything
was ready and the first Bear stepped up to make the trial, it was found
that in letting the arrow fly after drawing back the bow, his long
claws caught the string and spoiled the shot. This was annoying, but
some one suggested that they might trim his claws, which was
accordingly done, and on a second trial it was found that the arrow
went straight to the mark. But here the chief, the old White Bear,
objected, saying it was necessary that they should have long claws in
order to be able to climb trees. &ldquo;One of us has already died to
furnish the bow-string, and if we now cut off our claws we must all
starve together. It is better to trust to the teeth and claws that
nature gave us, for it is plain that man&rsquo;s weapons were not
intended for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one could think of any better plan, so the old chief dismissed
the council and the Bears dispersed to the woods and thickets without
having concerted any way to prevent the increase of the human race. Had
the result of the council been otherwise, we should now be at war with
the Bears, but as it is, the hunter does not even ask the Bear&rsquo;s
pardon when he kills one.</p>
<p>The Deer next held a council under their chief, the Little Deer, and
after some talk decided to send rheumatism to every hunter who should
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>kill one of them unless he took care to ask
their pardon for the offense. They sent notice of their decision to the
nearest settlement of Indians and told them at the same time what to do
when necessity forced them to kill one of the Deer tribe. Now, whenever
the hunter shoots a Deer, the Little Deer, who is swift as the wind and
can not be wounded, runs quickly up to the spot and, bending over the
blood-stains, asks the spirit of the Deer if it has heard the prayer of
the hunter for pardon. If the reply be &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; all is well,
and the Little Deer goes on his way; but if the reply be
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he follows on the trail of the hunter, guided by the
drops of blood on the ground, until he arrives at his cabin in the
settlement, when the Little Deer enters invisibly and strikes the
hunter with rheumatism, so that he becomes at once a helpless cripple.
No hunter who has regard for his health ever fails to ask pardon of the
Deer for killing it, although some hunters who have not learned the
prayer may try to turn aside the Little Deer from his pursuit by
building a fire behind them in the trail.</p>
<p>Next came the Fishes and Reptiles, who had their own complaints
against Man. They held their council together and determined to make
their victims dream of snakes twining about them in slimy folds and
blowing foul breath in their faces, or to make them dream of eating raw
or decaying fish, so that they would lose appetite, sicken, and die.
This is why people dream about snakes and fish.</p>
<p>Finally the Birds, Insects, and smaller animals came together for
the same purpose, and the Grubworm was chief of the council. It was
decided that each in turn should give an opinion, and then they would
vote on the question as to whether or not Man was guilty. Seven votes
should be enough to condemn him. One after another denounced
Man&rsquo;s cruelty and injustice toward the other animals and voted in
favor of his death. The Frog spoke first, saying: &ldquo;We must do
something to check the increase of the race, or people will become so
numerous that we shall be crowded from off the earth. See how they have
kicked me about because I&rsquo;m ugly, as they say, until my back is
covered with sores;&rdquo; and here he showed the spots on his skin.
Next came the Bird&mdash;no one remembers now which one it
was&mdash;who condemned Man &ldquo;because he burns my feet off,&rdquo;
meaning the way in which the hunter barbecues birds by impaling them on
a stick set over the fire, so that their feathers and tender feet are
singed off. Others followed in the same strain. The Ground-squirrel
alone ventured to say a good word for Man, who seldom hurt him because
he was so small, but this made the others so angry that they fell upon
the Ground-squirrel and tore him with their claws, and the stripes are
on his back to this day.</p>
<p>They began then to devise and name so many new diseases, one after
another, that had not their invention at last failed them, no one of
the human race would have been able to survive. The Grubworm grew
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>constantly more pleased as the name of each
disease was called off, until at last they reached the end of the list,
when some one proposed to make menstruation sometimes fatal to women.
On this he rose up in his place and cried:
&ldquo;<i>Wad&acirc;&ntilde;&prime;!</i> [Thanks!] I&rsquo;m glad some
more of them will die, for they are getting so thick that they tread on
me.&rdquo; The thought fairly made him shake with joy, so that he fell
over backward and could not get on his feet again, but had to wriggle
off on his back, as the Grubworm has done ever since.</p>
<p>When the Plants, who were friendly to Man, heard what had been done
by the animals, they determined to defeat the latters&rsquo; evil
designs. Each Tree, Shrub, and Herb, down even to the Grasses and
Mosses, agreed to furnish a cure for some one of the diseases named,
and each said: &ldquo;I shall appear to help Man when he calls upon me
in his need.&rdquo; Thus came medicine; and the plants, every one of
which has its use if we only knew it, furnish the remedy to counteract
the evil wrought by the revengeful animals. Even weeds were made for
some good purpose, which we must find out for ourselves. When the
doctor does not know what medicine to use for a sick man the spirit of
the plant tells him.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">5. THE DAUGHTER OF THE SUN</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Sun lived on the other side of the sky vault, but
her daughter lived in the middle of the sky, directly above the earth,
and every day as the Sun was climbing along the sky arch to the west
she used to stop at her daughter&rsquo;s house for dinner.</p>
<p>Now, the Sun hated the people on the earth, because they could never
look straight at her without screwing up their faces. She said to her
brother, the Moon, &ldquo;My grandchildren are ugly; they grin all over
their faces when they look at me.&rdquo; But the Moon said, &ldquo;I
like my younger brothers; I think they are very
handsome&rdquo;&mdash;because they always smiled pleasantly when they
saw him in the sky at night, for his rays were milder.</p>
<p>The Sun was jealous and planned to kill all the people, so every day
when she got near her daughter&rsquo;s house she sent down such sultry
rays that there was a great fever and the people died by hundreds,
until everyone had lost some friend and there was fear that no one
would be left. They went for help to the Little Men, who said the only
way to save themselves was to kill the Sun.</p>
<p>The Little Men made medicine and changed two men to snakes, the
Spreading-adder and the Copperhead, and sent them to watch near the
door of the daughter of the Sun to bite the old Sun when she came next
day. They went together and hid near the house until the Sun came, but
when the Spreading-adder was about to spring, the bright light blinded
him and he could only spit out yellow slime, as he does to this day
when he tries to bite. She called him a nasty thing and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>went
by into the house, and the Copperhead crawled off without trying to do
anything.</p>
<p>So the people still died from the heat, and they went to the Little
Men a second time for help. The Little Men made medicine again and
changed one man into the great Uktena and another into the Rattlesnake
and sent them to watch near the house and kill the old Sun when she
came for dinner. They made the Uktena very large, with horns on his
head, and everyone thought he would be sure to do the work, but the
Rattlesnake was so quick and eager that he got ahead and coiled up just
outside the house, and when the Sun&rsquo;s daughter opened the door to
look out for her mother, he sprang up and bit her and she fell dead in
the doorway. He forgot to wait for the old Sun, but went back to the
people, and the Uktena was so very angry that he went back, too. Since
then we pray to the rattlesnake and do not kill him, because he is kind
and never tries to bite if we do not disturb him. The Uktena grew
angrier all the time and very dangerous, so that if he even looked at a
man, that man&rsquo;s family would die. After a long time the people
held a council and decided that he was too dangerous to be with them,
so they sent him up to G&#259;l&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;l&#259;t&#301;,
and he is there now. The Spreading-adder, the Copperhead, the
Rattlesnake, and the Uktena were all men.</p>
<p>When the Sun found her daughter dead, she went into the house and
grieved, and the people did not die any more, but now the world was
dark all the time, because the Sun would not come out. They went again
to the Little Men, and these told them that if they wanted the Sun to
come out again they must bring back her daughter from
Ts&ucirc;sgin&acirc;&prime;&#301;, the Ghost country, in
Us&ucirc;&ntilde;hi&prime;y&#301;, the Darkening land in the west. They
chose seven men to go, and gave each a sourwood rod a hand-breadth
long. The Little Men told them they must take a box with them, and when
they got to Ts&ucirc;sgin&acirc;&prime;&#301; they would find all the
ghosts at a dance. They must stand outside the circle, and when the
young woman passed in the dance they must strike her with the rods and
she would fall to the ground. Then they must put her into the box and
bring her back to her mother, but they must be very sure not to open
the box, even a little way, until they were home again.</p>
<p>They took the rods and a box and traveled seven days to the west
until they came to the Darkening land. There were a great many people
there, and they were having a dance just as if they were at home in the
settlements. The young woman was in the outside circle, and as she
swung around to where the seven men were standing, one struck her with
his rod and she turned her head and saw him. As she came around the
second time another touched her with his rod, and then another and
another, until at the seventh round she fell out of the ring, and they
put her into the box and closed the lid fast. The other ghosts seemed
never to notice what had happened. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254"
href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>They took up the box and started home toward the east. In a little
while the girl came to life again and begged to be let out of the box,
but they made no answer and went on. Soon she called again and said she
was hungry, but still they made no answer and went on. After another
while she spoke again and called for a drink and pleaded so that it was
very hard to listen to her, but the men who carried the box said
nothing and still went on. When at last they were very near home, she
called again and begged them to raise the lid just a little, because
she was smothering. They were afraid she was really dying now, so they
lifted the lid a little to give her air, but as they did so there was a
fluttering sound inside and something flew past them into the thicket
and they heard a redbird cry, &ldquo;<i>kwish! kwish! kwish!</i>&rdquo;
in the bushes. They shut down the lid and went on again to the
settlements, but when they got there and opened the box it was
empty.</p>
<p>So we know the Redbird is the daughter of the Sun, and if the men
had kept the box closed, as the Little Men told them to do, they would
have brought her home safely, and we could bring back our other friends
also from the Ghost country, but now when they die we can never bring
them back.</p>
<p>The Sun had been glad when they started to the Ghost country, but
when they came back without her daughter she grieved and cried,
&ldquo;My daughter, my daughter,&rdquo; and wept until her tears made a
flood upon the earth, and the people were afraid the world would be
drowned. They held another council, and sent their handsomest young men
and women to amuse her so that she would stop crying. They danced
before the Sun and sang their best songs, but for a long time she kept
her face covered and paid no attention, until at last the drummer
suddenly changed the song, when she lifted up her face, and was so
pleased at the sight that she forgot her grief and smiled.</p>

<h4 class="main">6. HOW THEY BROUGHT BACK THE TOBACCO</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the beginning of the world, when people and animals
were all the same, there was only one tobacco plant, to which they all
came for their tobacco until the Dag&ucirc;l&#699;k&ucirc; geese stole
it and carried it far away to the south. The people were suffering
without it, and there was one old woman who grew so thin and weak that
everybody said she would soon die unless she could get tobacco to keep
her alive.</p>
<p>Different animals offered to go for it, one after another, the
larger ones first and then the smaller ones, but the
Dag&ucirc;l&#699;k&ucirc; saw and killed every one before he could get
to the plant. After the others the little Mole tried to reach it by
going under the ground, but the Dag&ucirc;l&#699;k&ucirc; saw his track
and killed him as he came out.</p>
<p>At last the Hummingbird offered, but the others said he was entirely
too small and might as well stay at home. He begged them to let him
try, so they showed him a plant in a field and told him to let them see
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>how he would go about it. The next moment he was
gone and they saw him sitting on the plant, and then in a moment he was
back again, but no one had seen him going or coming, because he was so
swift. &ldquo;This is the way I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said the
Hummingbird, so they let him try.</p>
<p>He flew off to the east, and when he came in sight of the tobacco
the Dag&ucirc;l&#699;k&ucirc; were watching all about it, but they
could not see him because he was so small and flew so swiftly. He
darted down on the plant&mdash;<i>tsa!</i>&mdash;and snatched off the
top with the leaves and seeds, and was off again before the
Dag&ucirc;l&#699;k&ucirc; knew what had happened. Before he got home
with the tobacco the old woman had fainted and they thought she was
dead, but he blew the smoke into her nostrils, and with a cry of
&ldquo;<i>Ts&acirc;&prime;l&ucirc;!</i> [Tobacco!]&rdquo; she opened
her eyes and was alive again.</p>
<div class="div4 variant">
<div class="divHead">
<h5 class="main">SECOND VERSION</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The people had tobacco in the beginning, but they had
used it all, and there was great suffering for want of it. There was
one old man so old that he had to be kept alive by smoking, and as his
son did not want to see him die he decided to go himself to try and get
some more. The tobacco country was far in the south, with high
mountains all around it, and the passes were guarded, so that it was
very hard to get into it, but the young man was a conjurer and was not
afraid. He traveled southward until he came to the mountains on the
border of the tobacco country. Then he opened his medicine bag and took
out a hummingbird skin and put it over himself like a dress. Now he was
a hummingbird and flew over the mountains to the tobacco field and
pulled some of the leaves and seed and put them into his medicine bag.
He was so small and swift that the guards, whoever they were, did not
see him, and when he had taken as much as he could carry he flew back
over the mountains in the same way. Then he took off the hummingbird
skin and put it into his medicine bag, and was a man again. He started
home, and on his way came to a tree that had a hole in the trunk, like
a door, near the first branches, and a very pretty woman was looking
out from it. He stopped and tried to climb the tree, but although he
was a good climber he found that he always slipped back. He put on a
pair of medicine moccasins from his pouch, and then he could climb the
tree, but when he reached the first branches he looked up and the hole
was still as far away as before. He climbed higher and higher, but
every time he looked up the hole seemed to be farther than before,
until at last he was tired and came down again. When he reached home he
found his father very weak, but still alive, and one draw at the pipe
made him strong again. The people planted the seed and have had tobacco
ever since.</p>

<h4 class="main">7. THE JOURNEY TO THE SUNRISE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A long time ago several young men made up their minds
to find the place where the Sun lives and see what the Sun is like.
They got <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>ready their bows and arrows, their parched corn
and extra moccasins, and started out toward the east. At first they met
tribes they knew, then they came to tribes they had only heard about,
and at last to others of which they had never heard.</p>
<p>There was a tribe of root eaters and another of acorn eaters, with
great piles of acorn shells near their houses. In one tribe they found
a sick man dying, and were told it was the custom there when a man died
to bury his wife in the same grave with him. They waited until he was
dead, when they saw his friends lower the body into a great pit, so
deep and dark that from the top they could not see the bottom. Then a
rope was tied around the woman&rsquo;s body, together with a bundle of
pine knots, a lighted pine knot was put into her hand, and she was
lowered into the pit to die there in the darkness after the last pine
knot was burned.</p>
<p>The young men traveled on until they came at last to the sunrise
place where the sky reaches down to the ground. They found that the sky
was an arch or vault of solid rock hung above the earth and was always
swinging up and down, so that when it went up there was an open place
like a door between the sky and ground, and when it swung back the door
was shut. The Sun came out of this door from the east and climbed along
on the inside of the arch. It had a human figure, but was too bright
for them to see clearly and too hot to come very near. They waited
until the Sun had come out and then tried to get through while the door
was still open, but just as the first one was in the doorway the rock
came down and crushed him. The other six were afraid to try it, and as
they were now at the end of the world they turned around and started
back again, but they had traveled so far that they were old men when
they reached home.</p>

<h4 class="main">8. THE MOON AND THE THUNDERS.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Sun was a young woman and lived in the East, while
her brother, the Moon, lived in the West. The girl had a lover who used
to come every month in the dark of the moon to court her. He would come
at night, and leave before daylight, and although she talked with him
she could not see his face in the dark, and he would not tell her his
name, until she was wondering all the time who it could be. At last she
hit upon a plan to find out, so the next time he came, as they were
sitting together in the dark of the &acirc;s&#301;, she slyly dipped
her hand into the cinders and ashes of the fireplace and rubbed it over
his face, saying, &ldquo;Your face is cold; you must have suffered from
the wind,&rdquo; and pretending to be very sorry for him, but he did
not know that she had ashes on her hand. After a while he left her and
went away again.</p>
<p>The next night when the Moon came up in the sky his face was covered
with spots, and then his sister knew he was the one who had been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>coming to see her. He was so much ashamed to
have her know it that he kept as far away as he could at the other end
of the sky all the night. Ever since he tries to keep a long way behind
the Sun, and when he does sometimes have to come near her in the west
he makes himself as thin as a ribbon so that he can hardly be seen.</p>
<p>Some old people say that the moon is a ball which was thrown up
against the sky in a game a long time ago. They say that two towns were
playing against each other, but one of them had the best runners and
had almost won the game, when the leader of the other side picked up
the ball with his hand&mdash;a thing that is not allowed in the
game&mdash;and tried to throw it to the goal, but it struck against the
solid sky vault and was fastened there, to remind players never to
cheat. When the moon looks small and pale it is because some one has
handled the ball unfairly, and for this reason they formerly played
only at the time of a full moon.</p>
<p>When the sun or moon is eclipsed it is because a great frog up in
the sky is trying to swallow it. Everybody knows this, even the Creeks
and the other tribes, and in the olden times, eighty or a hundred years
ago, before the great medicine men were all dead, whenever they saw the
sun grow dark the people would come together and fire guns and beat the
drum, and in a little while this would frighten off the great frog and
the sun would be all right again.</p>
<p>The common people call both Sun and Moon
<i>N&ucirc;&ntilde;d&#259;</i>, one being
&ldquo;N&ucirc;&ntilde;d&#259; that dwells in the day&rdquo; and the
other &ldquo;N&ucirc;&ntilde;d&#259; that dwells in the night,&rdquo;
but the priests call the Sun <i>Su&prime;t&#259;lidih&#301;&prime;</i>,
&ldquo;Six-killer,&rdquo; and the Moon
<i>Ge&prime;&#699;y&#259;gu&prime;ga</i>, though nobody knows now what
this word means, or why they use these names. Sometimes people ask the
Moon not to let it rain or snow.</p>
<p>The great Thunder and his sons, the two Thunder boys, live far in
the west above the sky vault. The lightning and the rainbow are their
beautiful dress. The priests pray to the Thunder and call him the Red
Man, because that is the brightest color of his dress. There are other
Thunders that live lower down, in the cliffs and mountains, and under
waterfalls, and travel on invisible bridges from one high peak to
another where they have their town houses. The great Thunders above the
sky are kind and helpful when we pray to them, but these others are
always plotting mischief. One must not point at the rainbow, or
one&rsquo;s finger will swell at the lower joint.</p>

<h4 class="main">9. WHAT THE STARS ARE LIKE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are different opinions about the stars. Some say
they are balls of light, others say they are human, but most people say
they are living creatures covered with luminous fur or feathers.</p>
<p>One night a hunting party camping in the mountains noticed two
lights like large stars moving along the top of a distant ridge. They
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>wondered and watched until the light disappeared
on the other side. The next night, and the next, they saw the lights
again moving along the ridge, and after talking over the matter decided
to go on the morrow and try to learn the cause. In the morning they
started out and went until they came to the ridge, where, after
searching some time, they found two strange creatures about <i>so</i>
large (making a circle with outstretched arms), with round bodies
covered with fine fur or downy feathers, from which small heads stuck
out like the heads of terrapins. As the breeze played upon these
feathers showers of sparks flew out.</p>
<p>The hunters carried the strange creatures back to the camp,
intending to take them home to the settlements on their return. They
kept them several days and noticed that every night they would grow
bright and shine like great stars, although by day they were only balls
of gray fur, except when the wind stirred and made the sparks fly out.
They kept very quiet, and no one thought of their trying to escape,
when, on the seventh night, they suddenly rose from the ground like
balls of fire and were soon above the tops of the trees. Higher and
higher they went, while the wondering hunters watched, until at last
they were only two bright points of light in the dark sky, and then the
hunters knew that they were stars.</p>

<h4 class="main">10. ORIGIN OF THE PLEIADES AND THE PINE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago, when the world was new, there were seven
boys who used to spend all their time down by the townhouse playing the
gatay&ucirc;&prime;st&#301; game, rolling a stone wheel along the
ground and sliding a curved stick after it to strike it. Their mothers
scolded, but it did no good, so one day they collected some
gatay&ucirc;&prime;st&#301; stones and boiled them in the pot with the
corn for dinner. When the boys came home hungry their mothers dipped
out the stones and said, &ldquo;Since you like the
gatay&ucirc;&prime;st&#301; better than the cornfield, take the stones
now for your dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were very angry, and went down to the townhouse, saying,
&ldquo;As our mothers treat us this way, let us go where we shall never
trouble them any more.&rdquo; They began a dance&mdash;some say it was
the Feather dance&mdash;and went round and round the townhouse, praying
to the spirits to help them. At last their mothers were afraid
something was wrong and went out to look for them. They saw the boys
still dancing around the townhouse, and as they watched they noticed
that their feet were off the earth, and that with every round they rose
higher and higher in the air. They ran to get their children, but it
was too late, for they were already above the roof of the
townhouse&mdash;all but one, whose mother managed to pull him down with
the gatay&ucirc;&prime;st&#301; pole, but he struck the ground with
such force that he sank into it and the earth closed over him.</p>
<p>The other six circled higher and higher until they went up to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>sky, where we see them now as the Pleiades,
which the Cherokee still call Ani&prime;tsuts&#259; (The Boys). The
people grieved long after them, but the mother whose boy had gone into
the ground came every morning and every evening to cry over the spot
until the earth was damp with her tears. At last a little green shoot
sprouted up and grew day by day until it became the tall tree that we
call now the pine, and the pine is of the same nature as the stars and
holds in itself the same bright light.</p>

<p class="first">Some people in the south had a corn mill, in which
they pounded the corn into meal, and several mornings when they came to
fill it they noticed that some of the meal had been stolen during the
night. They examined the ground and found the tracks of a dog, so the
next night they watched, and when the dog came from the north and began
to eat the meal out of the bowl they sprang out and whipped him. He ran
off howling to his home in the north, with the meal dropping from his
mouth as he ran, and leaving behind a white trail where now we see the

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the first man was created and a mate was given to
him, they lived together very happily for a time, but then began to
quarrel, until at last the woman left her husband and started off
toward N&ucirc;&ntilde;d&acirc;g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, the Sun
land, in the east. The man followed alone and grieving, but the woman
kept on steadily ahead and never looked behind, until
Une&prime;&#699;l&#259;n&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;h&#301;, the great
Apportioner (the Sun), took pity on him and asked him if he was still
angry with his wife. He said he was not, and
Une&prime;&#699;l&#259;n&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;h&#301; then asked him if
he would like to have her back again, to which he eagerly answered
yes.</p>
<p>So Une&prime;&#699;l&#259;n&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;h&#301; caused a
patch of the finest ripe huckleberries to spring up along the path in
front of the woman, but she passed by without paying any attention to
them. Farther on he put a clump of blackberries, but these also she
refused to notice. Other fruits, one, two, and three, and then some
trees covered with beautiful red service berries, were placed beside
the path to tempt her, but she still went on until suddenly she saw in
front a patch of large ripe strawberries, the first ever known. She
stooped to gather a few to eat, and as she picked them she chanced to
turn her face to the west, and at once the memory of her husband came
back to her and she found herself unable to go on. She sat down, but
the longer she waited the stronger became her desire for her husband,
and at last she gathered a bunch of the finest berries and started back
along the path to give them to him. He met her kindly and they went
home together. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=

<h4 class="main">13. THE GREAT YELLOW-JACKET: ORIGIN OF FISH AND
FROGS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A long time ago the people of the old town of
Kanu&prime;ga&#699;l&acirc;&prime;y&#301; (&ldquo;Brier place,&rdquo;
or Briertown), on Nantahala river, in the present Macon county, North
Carolina, were much annoyed by a great insect called
U&prime;la&#699;g&ucirc;&prime;, as large as a house, which used to
come from some secret hiding place, and darting swiftly through the
air, would snap up children from their play and carry them away. It was
unlike any other insect ever known, and the people tried many times to
track it to its home, but it was too swift to be followed.</p>
<p>They killed a squirrel and tied a white string to it, so that its
course could be followed with the eye, as bee hunters follow the flight
of a bee to its tree. The U&prime;la&#699;g&ucirc;&prime; came and
carried off the squirrel with the string hanging to it, but darted away
so swiftly through the air that it was out of sight in a moment. They
killed a turkey and put a longer white string to it, and the
U&prime;la&#699;g&ucirc;&prime; came and took the turkey, but was gone
again before they could see in what direction it flew. They took a deer
ham and tied a white string to it, and again the
U&prime;la&#699;g&ucirc;&prime; swooped down and bore it off so swiftly
that it could not be followed. At last they killed a yearling deer and
tied a very long white string to it. The
U&prime;la&#699;g&ucirc;&prime; came again and seized the deer, but
this time the load was so heavy that it had to fly slowly and so low
down that the string could be plainly seen.</p>
<p>The hunters got together for the pursuit. They followed it along a
ridge to the east until they came near where Franklin now is, when, on
looking across the valley to the other side, they saw the nest of the
U&prime;la&#699;g&ucirc;&prime; in a large cave in the rocks. On this
they raised a great shout and made their way rapidly down the mountain
and across to the cave. The nest had the entrance below with tiers of
cells built up one above another to the roof of the cave. The great
U&prime;la&#699;g&ucirc;&prime; was there, with thousands of smaller
ones, that we now call yellow-jackets. The hunters built fires around
the hole, so that the smoke filled the cave and smothered the great
insect and multitudes of the smaller ones, but others which were
outside the cave were not killed, and these escaped and increased until
now the yellow-jackets, which before were unknown, are all over the
world. The people called the cave
Tsg&acirc;g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Where the
yellow-jacket was,&rdquo; and the place from which they first saw the
nest they called A&#699;tahi&prime;ta, &ldquo;Where they
shouted,&rdquo; and these are their names today.</p>
<p>They say also that all the fish and frogs came from a great monster
fish and frog which did much damage until at last they were killed by
the people, who cut them up into little pieces which were thrown into
the water and afterward took shape as the smaller fishes and frogs.

<h4 class="main">14. THE DELUGE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A long time ago a man had a dog, which began to go
down to the river every day and look at the water and howl. At last the
man was angry and scolded the dog, which then spoke to him and said:
&ldquo;Very soon there is going to be a great freshet and the water
will come so high that everybody will be drowned; but if you will make
a raft to get upon when the rain comes you can be saved, but you must
first throw me into the water.&rdquo; The man did not believe it, and
the dog said, &ldquo;If you want a sign that I speak the truth, look at
the back of my neck.&rdquo; He looked and saw that the dog&rsquo;s neck
had the skin worn off so that the bones stuck out.</p>
<p>Then he believed the dog, and began to build a raft. Soon the rain
came and he took his family, with plenty of provisions, and they all
got upon it. It rained for a long time, and the water rose until the
mountains were covered and all the people in the world were drowned.
Then the rain stopped and the waters went down again, until at last it
was safe to come off the raft. Now there was no one alive but the man
and his family, but one day they heard a sound of dancing and shouting
on the other side of the ridge. The man climbed to the top and looked
over; everything was still, but all along the valley he saw great piles
of bones of the people who had been drowned, and then he knew that the
ghosts had been dancing.</p>

<div class="div3 story" id="s15">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">15. THE FOURFOOTED TRIBES</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Cherokee mythology, as in that of Indian tribes
generally, there is no essential difference between men and animals. In
the primal genesis period they seem to be completely undifferentiated,
and we find all creatures alike living and working together in harmony
and mutual helpfulness until man, by his aggressiveness and disregard
for the rights of the others, provokes their hostility, when insects,
birds, fishes, reptiles, and fourfooted beasts join forces against him
(see story, &ldquo;Origin of Disease and Medicine&rdquo;). Henceforth
their lives are apart, but the difference is always one of degree only.
The animals, like the people, are organized into tribes and have like
them their chiefs and townhouses, their councils and ballplays, and the
same hereafter in the Darkening land of
Us&ucirc;&ntilde;hi&prime;y&#301;. Man is still the paramount power,
and hunts and slaughters the others as his own necessities compel, but
is obliged to satisfy the animal tribes in every instance, very much as
a murder is compounded for, according to the Indian system, by
&ldquo;covering the bones of the dead&rdquo; with presents for the
bereaved relatives.</p>
<p>This pardon to the hunter is made the easier through a peculiar
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>doctrine of reincarnation, according to which,
as explained by the shamans, there is assigned to every animal a
definite life term which can not be curtailed by violent means. If it
is killed before the expiration of the allotted time the death is only
temporary and the body is immediately resurrected in its proper shape
from the blood drops, and the animal continues its existence until the
end of the predestined period, when the body is finally dissolved and
the liberated spirit goes to join its kindred shades in the Darkening
land. This idea appears in the story of the bear man and in the belief
concerning the Little Deer. Death is thus but a temporary accident and
the killing a mere minor crime. By some priests it is held that there
are seven successive reanimations before the final end.</p>
<p>Certain supernatural personages, Kana&prime;t&#301; and
Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime; (see the myths), have dominion over
the animals, and are therefore regarded as the distinctive gods of the
hunter. Kana&prime;t&#301; at one time kept the game animals, as well
as the pestiferous insects, shut up in a cave under ground, from which
they were released by his undutiful sons. The primeval
animals&mdash;the actors in the animal myths and the predecessors of
the existing species&mdash;are believed to have been much larger,
stronger, and cleverer than their successors of the present day. In
these myths we find the Indian explanation of certain peculiarities of
form, color, or habit, and the various animals are always consistently
represented as acting in accordance with their well-known
characteristics.</p>
<p>First and most prominent in the animal myths is the Rabbit
(<i>Tsistu</i>), who figures always as a trickster and deceiver,
generally malicious, but often beaten at his own game by those whom he
had intended to victimize. The connection of the rabbit with the dawn
god and the relation of the Indian myths to the stories current among
the southern negroes are discussed in another place. Ball players while
in training are forbidden to eat the flesh of the rabbit, because this
animal so easily becomes confused in running. On the other hand, their
spies seek opportunity to strew along the path which must be taken by
their rivals a soup made of rabbit hamstrings, with the purpose Of
rendering them timorous in action.</p>
<p>In a ball game between the birds and the fourfooted animals (see
story) the Bat, which took sides with the birds, is said to have won
the victory for his party by his superior dodging abilities. For this
reason the wings or sometimes the stuffed skin of the bat are tied to
the implements used in the game to insure success for the players.
According to the same myth the Flying Squirrel (<i>Tewa</i>) also aided
in securing the victory, and hence both these animals are still invoked
by the ball player. The meat of the common gray squirrel
(<i>s&#259;l&acirc;&prime;l&#301;</i>) is forbidden to rheumatic
patients, on account of the squirrel&rsquo;s habit of assuming a
cramped position when eating. The stripes upon the back of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>ground squirrel (<i>kiyu&prime;&#699;ga</i>) are
the mark of scratches made by the angry animals at a memorable council
in which he took it upon himself to say a good word for the archenemy,
Man (see &ldquo;Origin of Disease and Medicine&rdquo;). The
peculiarities of the mink (<i>s&ucirc;&ntilde;g&#301;</i>) are
accounted for by another story.</p>
<p>The buffalo, the largest game animal of America, was hunted in the
southern Allegheny region until almost the close of the last century,
the particular species being probably that known in the West as the
wood or mountain buffalo. The name in use among the principal gulf
tribes was practically the same, and can not be analyzed, viz,
Cherokee, <i>y&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;</i>; Hichitee,
<i>ya&prime;nasi</i>; Creek, <i>y&#277;na&prime;sa</i>; Choctaw,
<i>yanash</i>. Although the flesh of the buffalo was eaten, its skin
dressed for blankets and bed coverings, its long hair woven into belts,
and its horns carved into spoons, it is yet strangely absent from
Cherokee folklore. So far as is known it is mentioned in but a single
one of the sacred formulas, in which a person under treatment for
rheumatism is forbidden to eat the meat, touch the skin, or use a spoon
made from the horn of the buffalo, upon the ground of an occult
connection between the habitual cramped attitude of a rheumatic and the
natural &ldquo;hump&rdquo; of that animal.</p>
<p>The elk is known, probably by report, under the name of
<i>a&#699;w&#301;&prime; e&prime;gwa</i>, &ldquo;great deer&rdquo;, but
there is no myth or folklore in connection with it.</p>
<p>The deer, <i>a&#699;w&#301;&prime;</i>, which is still common in the
mountains, was the principal dependence of the Cherokee hunter, and is
consequently prominent in myth, folklore, and ceremonial. One of the
seven gentes of the tribe is named from it
(Ani&prime;-Kaw&#301;&prime;, &ldquo;Deer People&rdquo;). According to
a myth given elsewhere, the deer won his horns in a successful race
with the rabbit. Rheumatism is usually ascribed to the work of
revengeful deer ghosts, which the hunter has neglected to placate,
while on the other hand the aid of the deer is invoked against
frostbite, as its feet are believed to be immune from injury by frost.
The wolf, the fox, and the opossum are also invoked for this purpose,
and for the same reason. When the redroot (<i lang="la">Ceanothus
americanus</i>) puts forth its leaves the people say the young fawns
are then in the mountains. On killing a deer the hunter always cuts out
the hamstring from the hind quarter and throws it away, for fear that
if he ate it he would thereafter tire easily in traveling.</p>
<p>The powerful chief of the deer tribe is the A[&#699;]w&#301;&prime;
Usdi&prime;, or &ldquo;Little Deer,&rdquo; who is invisible to all
except the greatest masters of the hunting secrets, and can be wounded
only by the hunter who has supplemented years of occult study with
frequent fasts and lonely vigils. The Little Deer keeps constant
protecting watch over his subjects, and sees well to it that not one is
ever killed in wantonness. When a deer is shot by the hunter the Little
Deer knows it at once and is instantly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>at the spot. Bending
low his head he asks of the blood stains upon the ground if they have
heard&mdash;i. e., if the hunter has asked pardon for the life that he
has taken. If the formulistic prayer has been made, all is well,
because the necessary sacrifice has been atoned for; but if otherwise,
the Little Deer tracks the hunter to his house by the blood drops along
the trail, and, unseen and unsuspected, puts into his body the spirit
of rheumatism that shall rack him with aches and pains from that time
henceforth. As seen at rare intervals&mdash;perhaps once in a long
lifetime&mdash;the Little Deer is pure white and about the size of a
small dog, has branching antlers, and is always in company with a large
herd of deer. Even though shot by the master-hunter, he comes to life
again, being immortal, but the fortunate huntsman who can thus make
prize of his antlers has in them an unfailing talisman that brings him
success in the chase forever after. The smallest portion of one of
those horns of the Little Deer, when properly consecrated, attracts the
deer to the hunter, and when exposed from the wrapping dazes them so
that they forget to run and thus become an easy prey. Like the
Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301; stone (see <a href=
"#s50">number 50</a>), it is a dangerous prize when not treated with
proper respect, and is&mdash;or was&mdash;kept always in a secret place
away from the house to guard against sacrilegious handling.</p>
<p>Somewhat similar talismanic power attached to the down from the
young antler of the deer when properly consecrated. So firm was the
belief that it had influence over &ldquo;anything about a deer&rdquo;
that eighty and a hundred years ago even white traders used to bargain
with the Indians for such charms in order to increase their store of
deerskins by drawing the trade to themselves. The faith in the
existence of the miraculous Little Deer is almost as strong and
universal to-day among the older Cherokee as is the belief in a future
life.</p>
<p>The bears (<i>y&acirc;n&ucirc;</i>) are transformed Cherokee of the
old clan of the Ani&prime;-Ts&acirc;&prime;g&ucirc;h&#301; (see story,
&ldquo;Origin of the Bear&rdquo;). Their chief is the White Bear, who
lives at Kuw&acirc;&prime;h&#301;, &ldquo;Mulberry place,&rdquo; one of
the high peaks of the Great Smoky mountains, near to the enchanted lake
of Atag&acirc;&prime;h&#301; (see <a href="#s69">number 69</a>), to
which the wounded bears go to be cured of their hurts. Under
Kuw&acirc;&prime;h&#301; and each of three other peaks in the same
mountain region the bears have townhouses, where they congregate and
hold dances every fall before retiring to their dens for the winter.
Being really human, they can talk if they only would, and once a mother
bear was heard singing to her cub in words which the hunter understood.
There is one variety known as
<i>kal&acirc;s&prime;-g&ucirc;n&#259;hi&prime;ta</i>, &ldquo;long
hams,&rdquo; described as a large black bear with long legs and small
feet, which is always lean, and which the hunter does not care to
shoot, possibly on account of its leanness. It is believed that
new-born cubs are hairless, like mice.</p>
<p>The wolf (<i>wa&prime;&#699;ya</i>) is revered as the hunter and
watchdog of Kana&prime;t&#301;, and the largest gens in the tribe bears
the name of Ani&prime;-wa&prime;&#699;ya, &ldquo;Wolf <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>people.&rdquo; The ordinary Cherokee will never
kill one if he can possibly avoid it, but will let the animal go by
unharmed, believing that the kindred of a slain wolf will surely
revenge his death, and that the weapon with which the deed is done will
be rendered worthless for further shooting until cleaned and exorcised
by a medicine man. Certain persons, however, having knowledge of the
proper atonement rites, may kill wolves with impunity, and are hired
for this purpose by others who have suffered from raids upon their fish
traps or their stock. Like the eagle killer (see &ldquo;The Bird
Tribes&rdquo;), the professional wolf killer, after killing one of
these animals, addresses to it a prayer in which he seeks to turn aside
the vengeance of the tribe by laying the burden of blame upon the
people of some other settlement. He then unscrews the barrel of his gun
and inserts into it seven small sourwood rods heated over the fire, and
allows it to remain thus overnight in the running stream; in the
morning the rods are taken out and the barrel is thoroughly dried and
cleaned.</p>
<p>The dog (<i>gi&#699;l&#301;&prime;</i>), although as much a part of
Indian life among the Cherokee as in other tribes, hardly appears in
folklore. One myth makes him responsible for the milky way; another
represents him as driving the wolf from the comfortable house fire and
taking the place for himself. He figures also in connection with the
deluge. There is no tradition of the introduction of the horse
(<i>s&acirc;&prime;gw&#259;l&#301;</i>,
<i>as&acirc;&prime;gw&#259;lih&ucirc;&prime;</i>, &ldquo;a pack or
burden&rdquo;) or of the cow (<i>wa&prime;&#699;ka</i>, from the
Spanish, <i>vaca</i>). The hog is called <i>s&#301;kw&#259;</i>, this
being originally the name of the opossum, which somewhat resembles it
in expression, and which is now distinguished as <i>s&#301;kw&#259;
utse&prime;tst&#301;</i>, &ldquo;grinning s&#301;kw&#259;.&rdquo; In
the same way the sheep, another introduced animal, is called
<i>a&#699;w&#301;&prime; un&#259;de&prime;na</i>, &ldquo;woolly
deer&rdquo;; the goat, <i>a&#699;w&#301;&prime;
ah&#259;nu&prime;l&#259;h&#301;</i>, &ldquo;bearded deer,&rdquo; and
the mule, <a id="xd25e8385" name=
"xd25e8385"></a><i>s&acirc;&prime;gw&#259;&prime;l&#301;
dig&ucirc;&prime;lan&#259;hi&prime;ta</i>, &ldquo;long-eared
horse.&rdquo; The cat, also obtained from the whites, is called
<i>wes&#259;</i>, an attempt at the English &ldquo;pussy.&rdquo; When
it purrs by the fireside, the children say it is counting in Cherokee,
&ldquo;<i>ta&prime;ladu&prime;, n&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;g&#301;,
ta&prime;ladu&prime;, n&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;g&#301;,</i>&rdquo;
&ldquo;sixteen, four, sixteen, four.&rdquo; The elephant, which a few
of the Cherokee have seen in shows, is called by them
<i>k&#259;ma&prime;m&#259; u&prime;t&#259;n&ucirc;</i>, &ldquo;great
butterfly,&rdquo; from the supposed resemblance of its long trunk and
flapping ears to the proboscis and wings of that insect. The anatomical
peculiarities of the opossum, of both sexes, are the subject of much
curious speculation among the Indians, many of whom believe that its
young are produced without any help from the male. It occurs in one or
two of the minor myths.</p>
<p>The fox (<i>tsu&prime;&#699;l&#259;</i>) is mentioned in one of the
formulas, but does <span class="corr" id="xd25e8404" title=
"Source: no">not</span> appear in the tribal folklore. The black fox is
known by a different name (<i>in&acirc;&prime;l&#301;</i>). The odor of
the skunk (<i>d&#301;l&#259;&prime;</i>) is believed to keep off
contagious diseases, and the scent bag is therefore taken out and hung
over the doorway, a small hole being pierced in it in order that the
contents may ooze out upon the timbers. At times, as in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>smallpox epidemic of 1866, the entire body of
the animal was thus hung up, and in some cases, as an additional
safeguard, the meat was cooked and eaten and the oil rubbed over the
skin of the person. The underlying idea is that the fetid smell repels
the disease spirit, and upon the same principle the buzzard, which is
so evidently superior to carrion smells, is held to be powerful against
the same diseases.</p>
<p>The beaver (<i>d&acirc;&prime;y&#301;</i>), by reason of its
well-known gnawing ability, against which even the hardest wood is not
proof, is invoked on behalf of young children just getting their
permanent teeth. According to the little formula which is familiar to
nearly every mother in the tribe, when the loosened milk tooth is
pulled out or drops out of itself, the child runs with it around the
house, repeating four times, &ldquo;<i>D&acirc;&prime;y&#301;,
sk&#301;nt&#259;&prime;</i> (Beaver, put a new tooth into my
jaw)&rdquo; after which he throws the tooth upon the roof of the
house.</p>
<p>In a characteristic song formula to prevent frostbite the traveler,
before starting out on a cold winter morning, rubs his feet in the
ashes of the fire and sings a song of four verses, by means of which,
according to the Indian idea, he acquires in turn the cold-defying
powers of the wolf, deer, fox, and opossum, four animals whose feet, it
is held, are never frostbitten. After each verse he imitates the cry
and the action of the animal. The words used are archaic in form and
may be rendered &ldquo;I become a real wolf,&rdquo; etc. The song
runs:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">
<i>Ts&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;wa&prime;&#699;ya-ya&prime;</i> (repeated
four times), <i>wa + a!</i> (prolonged howl). (Imitates a wolf pawing
the ground with his feet.)</p>
<p class="line"><i>Ts&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;-ka&prime;wi-ye&prime;</i>
(repeated four times), <i>sauh! sauh! sauh! sauh!</i> (Imitates call
and jumping of a deer.)</p>
<p class="line">
<i>Ts&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;-tsu&prime;&#699;la-ya&prime;</i> (repeated

<p class="line">
<i>Ts&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;-s&#301;&prime;kwa-ya&prime;</i> (repeated

<h4 class="main">16. THE RABBIT GOES DUCK HUNTING</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Rabbit was so boastful that he would claim to do
whatever he saw anyone else do, and so tricky that he could usually
make the other animals believe it all. Once he pretended that he could
swim in the water and eat fish just as the Otter did, and when the
others told him to prove it he fixed up a plan so that the Otter
himself was deceived.</p>
<p>Soon afterward they met again and the Otter said, &ldquo;I eat ducks
sometimes.&rdquo; Said the Rabbit, &ldquo;Well, I eat ducks too.&rdquo;
The Otter challenged him to try it; so they went up along the river
until they saw several ducks in the water and managed to get near
without being seen. The Rabbit told the Otter to go first. The Otter
never hesitated, but dived from the bank and swam under water until he
reached the ducks, when he pulled one down without being noticed by the
others, and came back in the same way.</p>
<p>While the Otter had been under the water the Rabbit had peeled
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>some bark from a sapling and made himself a
noose. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Just watch me;&rdquo; and he
dived in and swam a little way under the water until he was nearly
choking and had to come up to the top to breathe. He went under again
and came up again a little nearer to the ducks. He took another breath
and dived under, and this time he came up among the ducks and threw the
noose over the head of one and caught it. The duck struggled hard and
finally spread its wings and flew up from the water with the Rabbit
hanging on to the noose.</p>
<p>It flew on and on until at last the Rabbit could not hold on any
longer, but had to let go and drop. As it happened, he fell into a
tall, hollow sycamore stump without any hole at the bottom to get out
from, and there he stayed until he was so hungry that he had to eat his
own fur, as the rabbit does ever since when he is starving. After
several days, when he was very weak with hunger, he heard children
playing outside around the trees. He began to sing:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Cut a door and look at me;</p>
<p class="line">I&rsquo;m the prettiest thing you ever did see.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The children ran home and told their father, who came
and began to cut a hole in the tree. As he chopped away the Rabbit
inside kept singing, &ldquo;Cut it larger, so you can see me better;
I&rsquo;m so pretty.&rdquo; They made the hole larger, and then the
Rabbit told them to stand back so that they could take a good look as
he came out. They stood away back, and the Rabbit watched his chance
and jumped out and got away.</p>

<h4 class="main">17. HOW THE RABBIT STOLE THE OTTER&rsquo;S COAT</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The animals were of different sizes and wore coats of
various colors and patterns. Some wore long fur and others wore short.
Some had rings on their tails, and some had no tails at all. Some had
coats of brown, others of black or yellow. They were always disputing
about their good looks, so at last they agreed to hold a council to
decide who had the finest coat.</p>
<p>They had heard a great deal about the Otter, who lived so far up the
creek that he seldom came down to visit the other animals. It was said
that he had the finest coat of all, but no one knew just what it was
like, because it was a long time since anyone had seen him. They did
not even know exactly where he lived&mdash;only the general direction;
but they knew he would come to the council when the word got out.</p>
<p>Now the Rabbit wanted the verdict for himself, so when it began to
look as if it might go to the Otter he studied up a plan to cheat him
out of it. He asked a few sly questions until he learned what trail the
Otter would take to get to the council place. Then, without saying
anything, he went on ahead and after four days&rsquo; travel he met the
Otter and knew him at once by his beautiful coat of soft dark-brown
fur. The Otter was glad to see him and asked him where he was going.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said the Rabbit, &ldquo;the
animals sent me to bring you to the council; because you live so far
away they were afraid you mightn&rsquo;t know the road.&rdquo; The
Otter thanked him, and they went on together.</p>
<p>They traveled all day toward the council ground, and at night the
Rabbit selected the camping place, because the Otter was a stranger in
that part of the country, and cut down bushes for beds and fixed
everything in good shape. The next morning they started on again. In
the afternoon the Rabbit began to pick up wood and bark as they went
along and to load it on his back. When the Otter asked what this was
for the Rabbit said it was that they might be warm and comfortable at
night. After a while, when it was near sunset, they stopped and made
their camp.</p>
<p>When supper was over the Rabbit got a stick and shaved it down to a
paddle. The Otter wondered and asked again what that was for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have good dreams when I sleep with a paddle under my
head,&rdquo; said the Rabbit.</p>
<p>When the paddle was finished the Rabbit began to cut away the bushes
so as to make a clean trail down to the river. The Otter wondered more
and more and wanted to know what this meant.</p>
<p>Said the Rabbit, &ldquo;This place is called
Di&prime;tatl&acirc;ski&prime;y&#301; [The Place Where it Rains Fire].
Sometimes it rains fire here, and the sky looks a little that way
to-night. You go to sleep and I&rsquo;ll sit up and watch, and if the
fire does come, as soon as you hear me shout, you run and jump into the
river. Better hang your coat on a limb over there, so it won&rsquo;t
get burnt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Otter did as he was told, and they both doubled up to go to
sleep, but the Rabbit kept awake. After a while the fire burned down to
red coals. The Rabbit called, but the Otter was fast asleep and made no
answer. In a little while he called again, but the Otter never stirred.
Then the Rabbit filled the paddle with hot coals and threw them up into
the air and shouted, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining fire! It&rsquo;s raining
fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hot coals fell all around the Otter and he jumped up. &ldquo;To
the water!&rdquo; cried the Rabbit, and the Otter ran and jumped into
the river, and he has lived in the water ever since.</p>
<p>The Rabbit took the Otter&rsquo;s coat and put it on, leaving his
own instead, and went on to the council. All the animals were there,
every one looking out for the Otter. At last they saw him in the
distance, and they said one to the other, &ldquo;The Otter is
coming!&rdquo; and sent one of the small animals to show him the best
seat. They were all glad to see him and went up in turn to welcome him,
but the Otter kept his head down, with one paw over his face. They
wondered that he was so bashful, until the Bear came up and pulled the
paw away, and there was the Rabbit with his split nose. He sprang up
and started to run, when the Bear struck at him and pulled his tail
off, but the Rabbit was too quick for them and got away. <span class=

<h4 class="main">18. WHY THE POSSUM&rsquo;S TAIL IS BARE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Possum used to have a long, bushy tail, and was so
proud of it that he combed it out every morning and sang about it at
the dance, until the Rabbit, who had had no tail since the Bear pulled
it out, became very jealous and made up his mind to play the Possum a
trick.</p>
<p>There was to be a great council and a dance at which all the animals
were to be present. It was the Rabbit&rsquo;s business to send out the
news, so as he was passing the Possum&rsquo;s place he stopped to ask
him if he intended to be there. The Possum said he would come if he
could have a special seat, &ldquo;because I have such a handsome tail
that I ought to sit where everybody can see me.&rdquo; The Rabbit
promised to attend to it and to send some one besides to comb and dress
the Possum&rsquo;s tail for the dance, so the Possum was very much
pleased and agreed to come.</p>
<p>Then the Rabbit went over to the Cricket, who is such an expert hair
cutter that the Indians call him the barber, and told him to go next
morning and dress the Possum&rsquo;s tail for the dance that night. He
told the Cricket just what to do and then went on about some other
mischief.</p>
<p>In the morning the Cricket went to the Possum&rsquo;s house and said
he had come to get him ready for the dance. So the Possum stretched
himself out and shut his eyes while the Cricket combed out his tail and
wrapped a red string around it to keep it smooth until night. But all
this time, as he wound the string around, he was clipping off the hair
close to the roots, and the Possum never knew it.</p>
<p>When it was night the Possum went to the townhouse where the dance
was to be and found the best seat ready for him, just as the Rabbit had
promised. When his turn came in the dance he loosened the string from
his tail and stepped into the middle of the floor. The drummers began
to drum and the Possum began to sing, &ldquo;See my beautiful
tail.&rdquo; Everybody shouted and he danced around the circle and sang
again, &ldquo;See what a fine color it has.&rdquo; They shouted again
and he danced around another time, singing, &ldquo;See how it sweeps
the ground.&rdquo; The animals shouted more loudly than ever, and the
Possum was delighted. He danced around again and sang, &ldquo;See how
fine the fur is.&rdquo; Then everybody laughed so long that the Possum
wondered what they meant. He looked around the circle of animals and
they were all laughing at him. Then he looked down at his beautiful
tail and saw that there was not a hair left upon it, but that it was as
bare as the tail of a lizard. He was so much astonished and ashamed
that he could not say a word, but rolled over helpless on the ground
and grinned, as the Possum does to this day when taken by surprise.</p>

<h4 class="main">19. HOW THE WILDCAT CAUGHT THE GOBBLER</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Wildcat once caught the Rabbit and was about to
kill him, when the Rabbit begged for his life, saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
so small I would make <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href=
"#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>only a mouthful for you, but if
you let me go I&rsquo;ll show you where you can get a whole drove of
Turkeys.&rdquo; So the Wildcat let him up and went with him to where
the Turkeys were.</p>
<p>When they came near the place the Rabbit said to the Wildcat,
&ldquo;Now, you must do just as I say. Lie down as if you were dead and
don&rsquo;t move, even if I kick you, but when I give the word jump up
and catch the largest one there.&rdquo; The Wildcat agreed and
stretched out as if dead, while the Rabbit gathered some rotten wood
and crumbled it over his eyes and nose to make them look flyblown, so
that the Turkeys would think he had been dead some time.</p>
<p>Then the Rabbit went over to the Turkeys and said, in a sociable
way, &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ve found our old enemy, the Wildcat, lying
dead in the trail. Let&rsquo;s have a dance over him.&rdquo; The
Turkeys were very doubtful, but finally went with him to where the
Wildcat was lying in the road as if dead. Now, the Rabbit had a good
voice and was a great dance leader, so he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lead
the song and you dance around him.&rdquo; The Turkeys thought that
fine, so the Rabbit took a stick to beat time and began to sing:
&ldquo;<i>G&#259;l&#259;gi&prime;na hasuyak&prime;,
G&#259;l&#259;gi&prime;na hasuyak&prime;</i> (pick out the Gobbler,
pick out the Gobbler).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; said the old Turkey. &ldquo;O,
that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the Rabbit, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
just the way he does, and we sing about it.&rdquo; He started the song
again and the Turkeys began to dance around the Wildcat. When they had
gone around several times the Rabbit said, &ldquo;Now go up and hit
him, as we do in the war dance.&rdquo; So the Turkeys, thinking the
Wildcat surely dead, crowded in close around him and the old gobbler
kicked him. Then the Rabbit drummed hard and sang his loudest,
&ldquo;Pick out the Gobbler, pick out the Gobbler,&rdquo; and the
Wildcat jumped up and caught the Gobbler.</p>

<h4 class="main">20. HOW THE TERRAPIN BEAT THE RABBIT</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Rabbit was a great runner, and everybody knew it.
No one thought the Terrapin anything but a slow traveler, but he was a
great warrior and very boastful, and the two were always disputing
about their speed. At last they agreed to decide the matter by a race.
They fixed the day and the starting place and arranged to run across
four mountain ridges, and the one who came in first at the end was to
be the winner.</p>
<p>The Rabbit felt so sure of it that he said to the Terrapin,
&ldquo;You know you can&rsquo;t run. You can never win the race, so
I&rsquo;ll give you the first ridge and then you&rsquo;ll have only
three to cross while I go over four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Terrapin said that would be all right, but that night when he
went home to his family he sent for his Terrapin friends and told them
he wanted their help. He said he knew he could not outrun the Rabbit,
but he wanted to stop the Rabbit&rsquo;s boasting. He explained his
plan to his friends and they agreed to help him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the day came all the animals were there to see the race. The
Rabbit was with them, but the Terrapin was gone ahead toward the first
ridge, as they had arranged, and they could hardly see him on account
of the long grass. The word was given and the Rabbit started off with
long jumps up the mountain, expecting to win the race before the
Terrapin could get down the other side. But before he got up the
mountain he saw the Terrapin go over the ridge ahead of him. He ran on,
and when he reached the top he looked all around, but could not see the
Terrapin on account of the long grass. He kept on down the mountain and
began to climb the second ridge, but when he looked up again there was
the Terrapin just going over the top. Now he was surprised and made his
longest jumps to catch up, but when he got to the top there was the
Terrapin away in front going over the third ridge. The Rabbit was
getting tired now and nearly out of breath, but he kept on down the
mountain and up the other ridge until he got to the top just in time to
see the Terrapin cross the fourth ridge and thus win the race.</p>
<p>The Rabbit could not make another jump, but fell over on the ground,
crying <i>m&#301;, m&#301;, m&#301;, m&#301;</i>, as the Rabbit does
ever since when he is too tired to run any more. The race was given to
the Terrapin and all the animals wondered how he could win against the
Rabbit, but he kept still and never told. It was easy enough, however,
because all the Terrapin&rsquo;s friends looked just alike, and he had
simply posted one near the top of each ridge to wait until the Rabbit
came in sight and then climb over and hide in the long grass. When the
Rabbit came on he could not find the Terrapin and so thought the
Terrapin was ahead, and if he had met one of the other terrapins he
would have thought it the same one because they looked so much alike.
The real Terrapin had posted himself on the fourth ridge, so as to come
in at the end of the race and be ready to answer questions if the
animals suspected anything.</p>
<p>Because the Rabbit had to lie down and lose the race the conjurer
now, when preparing his young men for the ball play, boils a lot of
rabbit hamstrings into a soup, and sends some one at night to pour it
across the path along which the other players are to come in the
morning, so that they may become tired in the same way and lose the
game. It is not always easy to do this, because the other party is
expecting it and has watchers ahead to prevent it.</p>

<h4 class="main">21. THE RABBIT AND THE TAR WOLF</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once there was such a long spell of dry weather that
there was no more water in the creeks and springs, and the animals held
a council to see what to do about it. They decided to dig a well, and
all agreed to help except the Rabbit, who was a lazy fellow, and said,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to dig for water. The dew on the grass is
enough for me.&rdquo; The others did not like this, but they went to
work together and dug their well. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272"
href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span></p>
<p>They noticed that the Rabbit kept sleek and lively, although it was
still dry weather and the water was getting low in the well. They said,
&ldquo;That tricky Rabbit steals our water at night,&rdquo; so they
made a wolf of pine gum and tar and set it up by the well to scare the
thief. That night the Rabbit came, as he had been coming every night,
to drink enough to last him all next day. He saw the queer black thing
by the well and said, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; but the tar wolf
said nothing. He came nearer, but the wolf never moved, so he grew
braver and said, &ldquo;Get out of my way or I&rsquo;ll strike
you.&rdquo; Still the wolf never moved and the Rabbit came up and
struck it with his paw, but the gum held his foot and it stuck fast.
Now he was angry and said, &ldquo;Let me go or I&rsquo;ll kick
you.&rdquo; Still the wolf said nothing. Then the Rabbit struck again
with his hind foot, so hard that it was caught in the gum and he could
not move, and there he stuck until the animals came for water in the
morning. When they found who the thief was they had great sport over
him for a while and then got ready to kill him, but as soon as he was
unfastened from the tar wolf he managed to get away.&mdash;Wafford.</p>

<h5 class="main">SECOND VERSION</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Once upon a time there was such a severe
drought that all streams of water and all lakes were dried up. In this
emergency the beasts assembled together to devise means to procure
water. It was proposed by one to dig a well. All agreed to do so except
the hare. She refused because it would soil her tiny paws. The rest,
however, dug their well and were fortunate enough to find water. The
hare beginning to suffer and thirst, and having no right to the well,
was thrown upon her wits to procure water. She determined, as the
easiest way, to steal from the public well. The rest of the animals,
surprised to find that the hare was so well supplied with water, asked
her where she got it. She replied that she arose betimes in the morning
and gathered the dewdrops. However the wolf and the fox suspected her
of theft and hit on the following plan to detect her:</p>
<p>They made a wolf of tar and placed it near the well. On the
following night the hare came as usual after her supply of water. On
seeing the tar wolf she demanded who was there. Receiving no answer she
repeated the demand, threatening to kick the wolf if he did not reply.
She receiving no reply kicked the wolf, and by this means adhered to
the tar and was caught. When the fox and wolf got hold of her they
consulted what it was best to do with her. One proposed cutting her
head off. This the hare protested would be useless, as it had often
been tried without hurting her. Other methods were proposed for
dispatching her, all of which she said would be useless. At last it was
proposed to let her loose to perish in a thicket. Upon this the hare
affected great uneasiness and pleaded hard for life. Her <span class=

accordingly let loose. As soon, however, as she was out of reach of her
enemies she gave a whoop, and bounding away she exclaimed: &lsquo;This

one would marry either of them. They talked over the matter and the
Rabbit said, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get wives here; let&rsquo;s go to
the next settlement. I&rsquo;m the messenger for the council, and
I&rsquo;ll tell the people that I bring an order that everybody must
take a mate at once, and then we&rsquo;ll be sure to get our
wives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Possum thought this a fine plan, so they started off together to
the next town. As the Rabbit traveled faster he got there first and
waited outside until the people noticed him and took him into the
townhouse. When the chief came to ask his business the Rabbit said he
brought an important order from the council that everybody must get
married without delay. So the chief called the people together and told
them the message from the council. Every animal took a mate at once,
and the Rabbit got a wife.</p>
<p>The Possum traveled so slowly that he got there after all the
animals had mated, leaving him still without a wife. The Rabbit
pretended to feel sorry for him and said, &ldquo;Never mind, I&rsquo;ll
carry the message to the people in the next settlement, and you hurry
on as fast as you can, and this time you will get your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he went on to the next town, and the Possum followed close after
him. But when the Rabbit got to the townhouse he sent out the word
that, as there had been peace so long that everybody was getting lazy
the council had ordered that there must be war at once and they must
begin right in the townhouse. So they all began fighting, but the
Rabbit made four great leaps and got away just as the Possum came in.
Everybody jumped on the Possum, who had not thought of bringing his
weapons on a wedding trip, and so could not defend himself. They had
nearly beaten the life out of him when he fell over and pretended to be
dead until he saw a good chance to jump up and get away. The Possum
never got a wife, but he remembers the lesson, and ever since he shuts
his eyes and pretends to be dead when the hunter has him in a close

They knew that the Rabbit was a great song leader, and they wanted to

your feet hard.&rdquo; The Wolves thought it fine. He began another
round singing the same song, and danced a little nearer to the field,
while the Wolves all stamped their feet. He sang louder and louder and
danced nearer and nearer to the field until at the fourth song, when
the Wolves were stamping as hard as they could and thinking only of the
song, he made one jump and was off through the long grass. They were
after him at once, but he ran for a hollow stump and climbed up on the
inside. When the the Wolves got there one of them put his head inside
to look up, but the Rabbit spit into his eye, so that he had to pull
his head out again. The others were afraid to try, and they went away,

<p>Flint wanted to know where the Rabbit&rsquo;s house was, and he told
him it was down in the broom-grass field near the river. So Flint
promised to make him a visit in a few days. &ldquo;Why not come now and
have supper with me?&rdquo; said the Rabbit, and after a little coaxing
Flint agreed and the two started down the mountain together.</p>
<p>When they came near the Rabbit&rsquo;s hole the Rabbit said,
&ldquo;There is my house, but in summer I generally stay outside here
where it is cooler.&rdquo; So he made a fire, and they had their supper
on the grass. When it was over, Flint stretched out to rest and the
Rabbit got some heavy sticks and his knife and cut out a mallet and
wedge. Flint looked up and asked what that was for. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
said the Rabbit, &ldquo;I like to be doing something, and they may come
handy.&rdquo; So Flint lay down again, and pretty soon he was sound
asleep. The Rabbit spoke to him once or twice to make sure, but there
was no answer. Then he came over to Flint and with one good blow of the
mallet he drove the sharp stake into his body and ran with all his
might for his own hole; but before he reached it there was a loud
explosion, and pieces of flint flew all about. That is why we find
flint in so many places now. One piece struck the Rabbit from behind
and cut him just as he dived into his hole. He sat listening until
everything seemed quiet again. Then he put his head out to look around,
but just at that moment another piece fell and struck him on the lip
and split it, as we still see it.</p>

<h4 class="main">26. HOW THE DEER GOT HIS HORNS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the beginning the Deer had no horns, but his head
was smooth just like a doe&rsquo;s. He was a great runner and the
Rabbit was a great jumper, and the animals were all curious to know
which could go farther in the same time. They talked about it a good
deal, and at last arranged a match between the two, and made a nice
large pair of antlers for a prize to the winner. They were to start
together from one side of a thicket and go through it, then turn and
come back, and the one who came out first was to get the horns.</p>
<p>On the day fixed all the animals were there, with the antlers put
down on the ground at the edge of the thicket to mark the starting
point. While everybody was admiring the horns the Rabbit said: &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know this part of the country; I want to take a look
through <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>the bushes where I am to run.&rdquo; They
thought that all right, so the Rabbit went into the thicket, but he was
gone so long that at last the animals suspected he must be up to one of
his tricks. They sent a messenger to look for him, and away in the
middle of the thicket he found the Rabbit gnawing down the bushes and
pulling them away until he had a road cleared nearly to the other
side.</p>
<p>The messenger turned around quietly and came back and told the other
animals. When the Rabbit came out at last they accused him of cheating,
but he denied it until they went into the thicket and found the cleared
road. They agreed that such a trickster had no right to enter the race
at all, so they gave the horns to the Deer, who was admitted to be the
best runner, and he has worn them ever since. They told the Rabbit that
as he was so fond of cutting down bushes he might do that for a living
hereafter, and so he does to this day.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">27. WHY THE DEER&rsquo;S TEETH ARE BLUNT</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Rabbit felt sore because the Deer had won the
horns (see the last story), and resolved to get even. One day soon
after the race he stretched a large grapevine across the trail and
gnawed it nearly in two in the middle. Then he went back a piece, took
a good run, and jumped up at the vine. He kept on running and jumping
up at the vine until the Deer came along and asked him what he was
doing?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; says the Rabbit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
so strong that I can bite through that grapevine at one
jump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deer could hardly believe this, and wanted to see it done. So
the Rabbit ran back, made a tremendous spring, and bit through the vine
where he had gnawed it before. The Deer, when he saw that, said,
&ldquo;Well, I can do it if you can.&rdquo; So the Rabbit stretched a
larger grapevine across the trail, but without gnawing it in the
middle. The Deer ran back as he had seen the Rabbit do, made a spring,
and struck the grapevine right in the center, but it only flew back and
threw him over on his head. He tried again and again, until he was all
bruised and bleeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see your teeth,&rdquo; at last said the Rabbit. So the
Deer showed him his teeth, which were long like a wolf&rsquo;s teeth,
but not very sharp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder you can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; says the Rabbit;
&ldquo;your teeth are too blunt to bite anything. Let me sharpen them
for you like mine. My teeth are so sharp that I can cut through a stick
just like a knife.&rdquo; And he showed him a black locust twig, of
which rabbits gnaw the young shoots, which he had shaved off as well as
a knife could do it, in regular rabbit fashion. The Deer thought that
just the thing. So the Rabbit got a hard stone with rough edges and
filed and filed away at the Deer&rsquo;s teeth until they were worn
down almost to the gums. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href=
"#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It hurts,&rdquo; said the Deer; but the Rabbit said it always
hurt a little when they began to get sharp; so the Deer kept quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now try it,&rdquo; at last said the Rabbit. So the Deer tried
again, but this time he could not bite at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve paid for your horns,&rdquo; said the Rabbit,
as he jumped away through the bushes. Ever since then the Deer&rsquo;s
teeth are so blunt that he can not chew anything but grass and
leaves.</p>

<h4 class="main">28. WHAT BECAME OF THE RABBIT</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Deer was very angry at the Rabbit for filing his
teeth and determined to be revenged, but he kept still and pretended to
be friendly until the Rabbit was off his guard. Then one day, as they
were going along together talking, he challenged the Rabbit to jump
against him. Now the Rabbit is a great jumper, as every one knows, so
he agreed at once. There was a small stream beside the path, as there
generally is in that country, and the Deer said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if you can jump across this branch.
We&rsquo;ll go back a piece, and then when I say <i>K&ucirc;!</i> then
both run and jump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Rabbit. So they went back to get a
good start, and when the Deer gave the word <i>K&ucirc;!</i> they ran
for the stream, and the Rabbit made one jump and landed on the other
side. But the Deer had stopped on the bank, and when the Rabbit looked
back the Deer had conjured the stream so that it was a large river. The
Rabbit was never able to get back again and is still on the other side.
The rabbit that we know is only a little thing that came
afterwards.</p>

would have nothing to do with him. He tried every way to win her favor,
but to no purpose, until at last he grew discouraged and made himself
sick thinking over it. The Mole came along, and finding him in such low
condition asked what was the trouble. The man told him the whole story,
and when he had finished the Mole said: &ldquo;I can help you, so that
she will not only like you, but will come to you of her own
will.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=

underground to where the girl was in bed asleep and took out her heart.
He came back by the same way and gave the heart to the man, who could
not see it even when it was put into his hand. &ldquo;There,&rdquo;
said the Mole, &ldquo;swallow it, and she will be drawn to come to you
and can not keep away.&rdquo; The man swallowed the heart, and when the
girl woke up she somehow thought at once of him, and felt a strange
desire to be with him, as though she must go to him at once. She
wondered and could not understand it, because she had always disliked
him before, but at last the feeling grew so strong that she was
compelled to go herself to the man and tell him she loved him and
wanted to be his wife. And so they were married, but all the magicians
who had known them both were surprised and wondered how it had come
about. When they found that it was the work of the Mole, whom they had
always before thought too insignificant for their notice, they were
very jealous and threatened to kill him, so that he hid himself under
the ground and has never since dared to come up to the surface.</p>

<h4 class="main">31. THE TERRAPIN&rsquo;S ESCAPE FROM THE WOLVES</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Possum and the Terrapin went out together to hunt
persimmons, and found a tree full of ripe fruit. The Possum climbed it
and was throwing down the persimmons to the Terrapin when a wolf came
up and began to snap at the persimmons as they fell, before the
Terrapin could reach them. The Possum waited his chance, and at last
managed to throw down a large one (some say a bone which he carried
with him), so that it lodged in the wolf&rsquo;s throat as he jumped up
at it and choked him to death. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take his ears for
hominy spoons,&rdquo; said the Terrapin, and cut off the wolf&rsquo;s
ears and started home with them, leaving the Possum still eating
persimmons up in the tree. After a while he came to a house and was
invited to have some <i>kanahe&prime;na</i> gruel from the jar that is
set always outside the door. He sat down beside the jar and dipped up
the gruel with one of the wolf&rsquo;s ears for a spoon. The people
noticed and wondered. When he was satisfied he went on, but soon came
to another house and was asked to have some more kanahe&prime;na. He
dipped it up again with the wolf&rsquo;s ear and went on when he had
enough. Soon the news went around that the Terrapin had killed the Wolf
and was using his ears for spoons. All the Wolves got together and
followed the Terrapin&rsquo;s trail until they came up with him and
made him prisoner. Then they held a council to decide what to do with
him, and agreed to boil him in a clay pot. They brought in a pot, but
the Terrapin only laughed at it and said that if they put him into that
thing he would kick it all to pieces. They said they would burn him in
the fire, but the Terrapin laughed again and said he would put it out.
Then they decided to throw him into the deepest hole in the river and
drown him. The Terrapin <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href=
"#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>begged and prayed them not to do
that, but they paid no attention, and dragged him over to the river and
threw him in. That was just what the Terrapin had been waiting for all
the time, and he dived under the water and came up on the other side
and got away.</p>
<p>Some say that when he was thrown into the river he struck against a
rock, which broke his back in a dozen places. He sang a medicine
song:</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<h4 class="main">32. ORIGIN OF THE GROUNDHOG DANCE: THE
GROUNDHOG&rsquo;S HEAD</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Seven wolves once caught a Groundhog and said,
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll kill you and have something good to eat.&rdquo;
But the Groundhog said, &ldquo;When we find good food we must rejoice
over it, as people do in the Green-corn dance. I know you mean to kill
me and I can&rsquo;t help myself, but if you want to dance I&rsquo;ll
sing for you. This is a new dance entirely. I&rsquo;ll lean up against
seven trees in turn and you will dance out and then turn and come back,
as I give the signal, and at the last turn you may kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wolves were very hungry, but they wanted to learn the new dance,
so they told him to go ahead. The Groundhog leaned up against a tree
and began the song, <i>Ha&prime;wiye&prime;&#277;h&#301;&prime;</i>,
and all the wolves danced out in front, until he gave the signal,
<i>Yu!</i> and began with <i>Hi&prime;yagu&prime;w&#277;</i>, when they
turned and danced back in line. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said
the Groundhog, and went over to the next tree and started the second
song. The wolves danced out and then turned at the signal and danced
back again. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very fine,&rdquo; said the Groundhog,
and went over to another tree and started the third song. The wolves
danced their best and the Groundhog encouraged them, but at each song
he took another tree, and each tree was a little nearer to his hole
under a stump. At the seventh song he said, &ldquo;Now, this is the
last dance, and when I say <i>Yu!</i> you will all turn and come after
me, and the one who gets me may have me.&rdquo; So he began the seventh
song and kept it up until the wolves were away out in front. Then he
gave the signal, <i>Yu!</i> and made a jump for his hole. The wolves
turned and were after him, but he reached the hole first and dived in.
Just as he got inside, the foremost wolf caught him by the tail and
gave it such a pull that it broke off, and the Groundhog&rsquo;s tail
has been short ever since.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The unpleasant smell of the Groundhog&rsquo;s head was given it by
the other animals to punish an insulting remark made by him in council.

DOG</h4>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Kana&prime;t&#301; had wolves to hunt for him, because
they are good hunters and never fail. He once sent out two wolves at
once. One went to the east and did not return. The other went to the
north, and when he returned at night and did not find his fellow he
knew he must be in trouble and started after him. After traveling on
some time he found his brother lying nearly dead beside a great
greensnake (<i>s&#259;likw&acirc;&prime;y&#301;</i>) which had attacked
him. The snake itself was too badly wounded to crawl away, and the
angry wolf, who had magic powers, taking out several hairs from his own
whiskers, shot them into the body of the snake and killed it. He then
hurried back to Kana&prime;t&#301;, who sent the Terrapin after a great
doctor who lived in the west to save the wounded wolf. The wolf went
back to help his brother and by his magic powers he had him cured long
before the doctor came from the west, because the Terrapin was such a
slow traveler and the doctor had to prepare his roots before he
started.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In the beginning, the people say, the Dog was put on the mountain
and the Wolf beside the fire. When the winter came the Dog could not
stand the cold, so he came down to the settlement and drove the Wolf
from the fire. The Wolf ran to the mountains, where it suited him so
well that he prospered and increased, until after a while he ventured
down again and killed some animals in the settlements. The people got
together and followed and killed him, but his brothers came from the
mountains and took such revenge that ever since the people have been
afraid to hurt a wolf.</p>

<div class="div3 story" id="s35">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">35. THE BIRD TRIBES</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Winged creatures of all kinds are classed under the
generic term of <i>anin&acirc;&prime;hilid&acirc;&prime;h&#301;</i>
(flyers). Birds are called, alike in the singular and plural,
<i>tsi&prime;skwa</i>, the term being generally held to exclude the
domestic fowls introduced by the whites. When it is necessary to make
the distinction they are mentioned, respectively, as
<i>in&#259;g&#277;h&#301;</i> (living in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>woods), and <i>ulu&ntilde;ni&prime;ta</i>
(tame). The robin is called <i>tsiskwa&prime;gw&#259;</i>, a name which
can not be analyzed, while the little sparrow is called
<i>tsiskw&acirc;&prime;y&#259;</i> (the real or principal bird),
perhaps, in accord with a principle in Indian nomenclature, on account
of its wide distribution. As in other languages, many of the bird names
are onomatopes, as <i>wa&#699;huhu&prime;</i> (the screech owl),
<i>u&prime;guku&prime;</i> (the hooting owl), <i>wagul&#301;&prime;</i>
(the whippoorwill), <i>k&acirc;g&ucirc;</i> (the crow),
<i>g&#365;gw&#277;&prime;</i> (the quail), <i>huhu</i> (the yellow
mocking-bird), <i>ts&#301;&prime;k&#301;lil&#301;&prime;</i> (the
chickadee), <i>sa&prime;sa&prime;</i> (the goose). The turtledove is
called <i>gul&#277;&prime;-diska&#699;nih&#301;&prime;</i> (it cries
for acorns), on account of the resemblance of its cry to the sound of
the word for acorn (<i>gul&#277;&prime;</i>). The meadow lark is called
<i>n&#259;kw&#301;s&#301;&prime;</i> (star), on account of the
appearance of its tail when spread out as it soars. The nuthatch
(<i>Sitta carolinensis</i>) is called <i>tsulie&prime;na</i> (deaf),
and is supposed to be without hearing, possibly on account of its
fearless disregard for man&rsquo;s presence. Certain diseases are
diagnosed by the doctors as due to birds, either revengeful bird
ghosts, bird feathers about the house, or bird shadows falling upon the
patient from overhead.</p>
<p>The eagle (<i>aw&acirc;&prime;h&#301;l&#301;</i>) is the great
sacred bird of the Cherokee, as of nearly all our native tribes, and
figures prominently in their ceremonial ritual, especially in all
things relating to war. The particular species prized was the golden or
war eagle (<i>Aquila chrys&aelig;tus</i>), called by the Cherokee the
&ldquo;pretty-feathered eagle,&rdquo; on account of its beautiful tail
feathers, white, tipped with black, which were in such great demand for
decorative and ceremonial purposes that among the western tribes a
single tail was often rated as equal in value to a horse. Among the
Cherokee in the old times the killing of an eagle was an event which
concerned the whole settlement, and could be undertaken only by the
professional eagle killer, regularly chosen for the purpose on account
of his knowledge of the prescribed forms and the prayers to be said
afterwards in order to obtain pardon for the necessary sacrilege, and
thus ward off vengeance from the tribe. It is told of one man upon the
reservation that having deliberately killed an eagle in defiance of the
ordinances he was constantly haunted by dreams of fierce eagles
swooping down upon him, until the nightmare was finally exorcised after
a long course of priestly treatment. In 1890 there was but one eagle
killer remaining among the East Cherokee. It does not appear that the
eagle was ever captured alive as among the plains tribes.</p>
<p>The eagle must be killed only in the winter or late fall after the
crops were gathered and the snakes had retired to their dens. If killed
in the summertime a frost would come to destroy the corn, while the
songs of the Eagle dance, when the feathers were brought home, would so
anger the snakes that they would become doubly dangerous. Consequently
the Eagle songs were never sung until after the snakes had gone to
sleep for the winter.</p>
<p>When the people of a town had decided upon an Eagle dance the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>eagle killer was called in, frequently from a
distant settlement, to procure the feathers for the occasion. He was
paid for his services from offerings made later at the dance, and as
the few professionals guarded their secrets carefully from outsiders
their business was a quite profitable one. After some preliminary
preparation the eagle killer sets out alone for the mountains, taking
with him his gun or bow and arrows. Having reached the mountains, he
goes through a vigil of prayer and fasting, possibly lasting four days,
after which he hunts until he succeeds in killing a deer. Then, placing
the body in a convenient exposed situation upon one of the highest
cliffs, he conceals himself near by and begins to sing in a low
undertone the songs to call down the eagles from the sky. When the
eagle alights upon the carcass, which will be almost immediately if the
singer understands his business, he shoots it, and then standing over
the dead bird, he addresses to it a prayer in which he begs it not to
seek vengeance upon his tribe, because it is not a Cherokee, but a
Spaniard (<i>Askwa&prime;n&#301;</i>) that has done the deed. The
selection of such a vicarious victim of revenge is evidence at once of
the antiquity of the prayer in its present form and of the enduring
impression which the cruelties of the early Spanish adventurers made
upon the natives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span></p>
<p>The prayer ended, he leaves the dead eagle where it fell and makes
all haste to the settlement, where the people are anxiously expecting
his return. On meeting the first warriors he says simply, &ldquo;A
snowbird has died,&rdquo; and passes on at once to his own quarters,
his work being now finished. The announcement is made in this form in
order to insure against the vengeance of any eagles that might
overhear, the little snowbird being considered too insignificant a
creature to be dreaded.</p>
<p>Having waited four days to allow time for the insect parasites to
leave the body, the hunters delegated for the purpose go out to bring
in the feathers. On arriving at the place they strip the body of the
large tail and wing feathers, which they wrap in a fresh deerskin
brought with them, and then return to the settlement, leaving the body
of the dead eagle upon the ground, together with that of the slain
deer, the latter being intended as a sacrifice to the eagle spirits. On
reaching the settlement, the feathers, still wrapped in the deerskin,
are hung up in a small, round hut built for this special purpose near
the edge of the dance ground
(<i>dets&#259;n&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;l&#301;</i>) and known as the
place &ldquo;where the feathers are kept,&rdquo; or feather house. Some
settlements had two such feather houses, one at each end of the dance
ground. The Eagle dance was held on the night of the same day on which
the feathers were brought in, all the necessary arrangements having
been made beforehand. In the meantime, as the feathers were supposed to
be hungry after their journey, a dish of venison and corn was set upon
the ground below them and they were invited to eat. The body of a
flaxbird or scarlet tanager (<i>Piranga rubra</i>) was also hung up
with the feathers for the same purpose. The food thus given to the
feathers was disposed of after the dance, as described in another
place.</p>
<p>The eagle being regarded as a great ada&prime;weh&#301;, only the
greatest warriors and those versed in the sacred ordinances would dare
to wear the feathers or to carry them in the dance. Should any person
in the settlement dream of eagles or eagle feathers he must arrange for
an Eagle dance, with the usual vigil and fasting, at the first
opportunity; otherwise some one of his family will die. Should the
insect parasites which infest the feathers of the bird in life get upon
a man they will breed a skin disease which is sure to develop, even
though it may be latent for years. It is for this reason that the body
of the eagle is allowed to remain four days upon the ground before
being brought into the settlement.</p>
<p>The raven (<i>k&acirc;&prime;l&#259;n&ucirc;</i>) is occasionally
seen in the mountains, but is not prominent in folk belief, excepting
in connection with the grewsome tales of the Raven Mocker (q. v.). In
former times its name was sometimes assumed as a war title. The crow,
so prominent in other tribal mythologies, does not seem to appear in
that of the Cherokee. Three <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href=
"#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>varieties of owls are recognized,
each under a different name, viz: <i>tsk&#301;l&#301;&prime;</i>, the
dusky horned owl (<i lang="la">Bubo virginianus saturatus</i>);
<i>u&prime;guku&prime;</i>, the barred or hooting owl (<i lang=
"la">Syrnium nebulosum</i>), and <i>wa&#699;huhu&prime;</i>, the
screech owl (<i lang="la">Megascops asio</i>). The first of these names
signifies a witch, the others being onomatopes. Owls and other
night-crying birds are believed to be embodied ghosts or disguised
witches, and their cry is dreaded as a sound of evil omen. If the eyes
of a child be bathed with water in which one of the long wing or tail
feathers of an owl has been soaked, the child will be able to keep
awake all night. The feather must be found by chance, and not procured
intentionally for the purpose. On the other hand, an application of
water in which the feather of a blue jay, procured in the same way, has
been soaked will make the child an early riser.</p>
<p>The buzzard (<i>sul&#301;&prime;</i>) is said to have had a part in
shaping the earth, as was narrated in the genesis myth. It is reputed
to be a doctor among birds, and is respected accordingly, although its
feathers are never worn by ball players, for fear of becoming bald. Its
own baldness is accounted for by a vulgar story. As it thrives upon
carrion and decay, it is held to be immune from sickness, especially of
a contagious character, and a small quantity of its flesh eaten, or of
the soup used as a wash, is believed to be a sure preventive of
smallpox, and was used for this purpose during the smallpox epidemic
among the East Cherokee in 1866. According to the Wahnenauhi
manuscript, it is said also that a buzzard feather placed over the
cabin door will keep out witches. In treating gunshot wounds, the
medicine is blown into the wound through a tube cut from a buzzard
quill and some of the buzzard&rsquo;s down is afterwards laid over the
spot.</p>
<p>There is very little concerning hawks, excepting as regards the
great mythic hawk, the <i>Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;&prime;</i>. The
<i>tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;&prime; usdi&prime;</i>, or &ldquo;little
tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;,&rdquo; is described as a bird about as large
as a turkey and of a grayish blue color, which used to follow the
flocks of wild pigeons, flying overhead and darting down occasionally
upon a victim, which it struck and killed with its sharp breast and ate
upon the wing, without alighting. It is probably the goshawk (<i lang=
"la">Astur atricapillus</i>).</p>
<p>The common swamp gallinule, locally known as mudhen or didapper
(<i lang="la">Gallinula galeata</i>), is called
<i>diga&prime;gwan&#301;&prime;</i> (lame or crippled), on account of
its habit of flying only for a very short distance at a time. In the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e8919" title=
"Source: Diga&prime;gwan&#301;">Diga&prime;gwan&#301;&prime;</span>
dance the performers sing the name of the bird and endeavor to imitate
its halting movements. The <i>dag&ucirc;l&prime;k&ucirc;</i>, or
white-fronted goose (<i lang="la">Anser albifrons</i>), appears in
connection with the myth of the origin of tobacco. The feathers of the
<i>tskw&acirc;y&#301;</i>, the great white heron or American egret
(<i lang="la">Herodias egretta</i>), are worn by ball players, and this
bird probably the &ldquo;swan&rdquo; whose white wing was used as a
peace emblem in ancient times.</p>

<p class="figureHead">SAW&#258;NU&prime;G&#300;, A CHEROKEE
BALL-PLAYER</p>
</div>
<p>A rare bird said to have been seen occasionally upon the reservation
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>many years ago was called by the curious name of
<i>n&ucirc;&ntilde;d&#259;-dikan&#301;&prime;</i>, &ldquo;it looks at
the sun,&rdquo; &ldquo;sun-gazer.&rdquo; It is described as resembling
a blue crane, and may possibly have been the <i>Floridus cerulea</i>,
or little blue heron. Another infrequent visitor, which sometimes
passed over the mountain country in company with flocks of wild geese,
was the <i>gu&prime;wisguw&#301;&prime;</i>, so called from its cry. It
is described as resembling a large snipe, with yellow legs and feet
unwebbed, and is thought to visit Indian Territory at intervals. It is
chiefly notable from the fact that the celebrated chief John Ross
derives his Indian name, Gu&prime;wisguw&#301;&prime;, from this bird,
the name being perpetuated in Cooweescoowee district of the Cherokee
Nation in the West.</p>
<p>Another chance visitant, concerning which there is much curious
speculation among the older men of the East Cherokee, was called
<i>tsun&prime;digw&ucirc;ntsu&prime;&#699;g&#301;</i> or
<i>tsun&prime;digw&ucirc;n&prime;tsk&#301;</i>, &ldquo;forked,&rdquo;
referring to the tail. It appeared but once, for a short season, about
forty years ago, and has not been seen since. It is said to have been
pale blue, with red in places, and nearly the size of a crow, and to
have had a long forked tail like that of a fish. It preyed upon
hornets, which it took upon the wing, and also feasted upon the
larv&aelig; in the nests. Appearing unexpectedly and as suddenly
disappearing, it was believed to be not a bird but a transformed
red-horse fish (<i>Moxostoma</i>, Cherokee
<i>&acirc;lig&#259;&prime;</i>), a theory borne out by the red spots
and the long, forked tail. It is even maintained that about the time
those birds first appeared some hunters on Oconaluftee saw seven of
them sitting on the limb of a tree and they were still shaped like a
red-horse, although they already had wings and feathers. It was
undoubtedly the scissor-tail or swallow-tailed flycatcher (<i lang=
"la">Milvulus forficatus</i>), which belongs properly in Texas and the
adjacent region, but strays occasionally into the eastern states.</p>
<p>On account of the red throat appendage of the turkey, somewhat
resembling the goitrous growth known in the South as
&ldquo;kernels&rdquo; (Cherokee, <i>dule&prime;ts&#301;</i>), the
feathers of this bird are not worn by ball players, neither is the neck
allowed to be eaten by children or sick persons, under the fear that a
growth of &ldquo;kernels&rdquo; would be the result. The meat of the
ruffed grouse, locally known as the pheasant (<i>Bonasa umbellus</i>),
is tabued to a pregnant woman, because this bird hatches a large brood,
but loses most of them before maturity. Under a stricter construction
of the theory this meat is forbidden to a woman until she is past child
bearing.</p>
<p>The redbird, <i>tatsu&prime;hw&#259;</i>, is believed to have been
originally the daughter of the Sun (see the story). The <i>huhu</i>, or
yellow mocking-bird, occurs in several stories. It is regarded as
something supernatural, possibly on account of its imitative powers,
and its heart is given to children to make them quick to learn.</p>
<p>The chickadee (<i>Parus carolinensis</i>),
<i>ts&#301;k&#301;lil&#301;&prime;</i>, and the tufted titmouse,
(<i>Parus bicolor</i>), <i>utsu&prime;&#699;g&#301;</i>, or
<i>u&prime;st&ucirc;t&#301;</i>, are both regarded as news <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>bringers, but the one is venerated as a truth
teller while the other is scoffed at as a lying messenger, for reasons
which appear in the story of N&ucirc;&ntilde;yunu&prime;w&#301; (q.
v.). When the ts&#301;k&#301;lil&#301;&prime; perches on a branch near
the house and chirps its song it is taken as an omen that an absent
friend will soon be heard from or that a secret enemy is plotting
mischief. Many stories are told in confirmation of this belief, among
which may be instanced that of Tom Starr, a former noted outlaw of the
Cherokee Nation of the West, who, on one occasion, was about to walk
unwittingly into an ambush prepared for him along a narrow trail, when
he heard the warning note of the ts&#301;k&#301;lil&#301;&prime;, and,
turning abruptly, ran up the side of the ridge and succeeded in
escaping with his life, although hotly pursued by his enemies.</p>

<h4 class="main">36. THE BALL GAME OF THE BIRDS AND ANIMALS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once the animals challenged the birds to a great
ballplay, and the birds accepted. The leaders made the arrangements and
fixed the day, and when the time came both parties met at the place for
the ball dance, the animals on a smooth grassy bottom near the river
and the birds in the treetops over by the ridge. The captain of the
animals was the Bear, who was so strong and heavy that he could pull
down anyone who got in his way. All along the road to the ball ground
he was tossing up great logs to show his strength and boasting of what
he would do to the birds when the game began. The Terrapin,
too&mdash;not the little one we have now, but the great original
Terrapin&mdash;was with the animals. His shell was so hard that the
heaviest blows could not hurt him, and he kept rising up on his hind
legs and dropping heavily again to the ground, bragging that this was
the way he would crush any bird that tried to take the ball from him.
Then there was the Deer, who could outrun every other animal.
Altogether it was a fine company.</p>
<p>The birds had the Eagle for their captain, with the Hawk and the
great Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;, all swift and strong of flight, but
still they were a little afraid of the animals. The dance was over and
they were all pruning their feathers up in the trees and waiting for
the captain to give the word when here came two little things hardly
larger than field mice climbing up the tree in which sat perched the
bird captain. At last they reached the top, and creeping along the limb
to where the Eagle captain sat they asked to be allowed to join in the
game. The captain looked at them, and seeing that they were
four-footed, he asked why they did not go to the animals, where they
belonged. The little things said that they had, but the animals had
made fun of them and driven them off because they were so small. Then
the bird captain pitied them and wanted to take them.</p>
<p>But how could they join the birds when they had no wings? The Eagle,
the Hawk, and the others consulted, and at last it was decided
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>to make some wings for the little fellows. They
tried for a long time to think of something that might do, until
someone happened to remember the drum they had used in the dance. The
head was of ground-hog skin and maybe they could cut off a corner and
make wings of it. So they took two pieces of leather from the drumhead
and cut them into shape for wings, and stretched them with cane splints
and fastened them on to the forelegs of one of the small animals, and
in this way came <i>Tla&prime;meh&#259;</i>, the Bat. They threw the
ball to him and told him to catch it, and by the way he dodged and
circled about, keeping the ball always in the air and never letting it
fall to the ground, the birds soon saw that he would be one of their
best men.</p>
<p>Now they wanted to fix the other little animal, but they had used up
all their leather to make wings for the Bat, and there was no time to
send for more. Somebody said that they might do it by stretching his
skin, so two large birds took hold from opposite sides with their
strong bills, and by pulling at his fur for several minutes they
managed to stretch the skin on each side between the fore and hind
feet, until they had <i>Tewa</i>, the Flying Squirrel. To try him the
bird captain threw up the ball, when the Flying Squirrel sprang off the
limb after it, caught it in his teeth and carried it through the air to
another tree nearly across the bottom.</p>
<p>When they were all ready the signal was given and the game began,
but almost at the first toss the Flying Squirrel caught the ball and
carried it up a tree, from which he threw it to the birds, who kept it
in the air for some time until it dropped. The Bear rushed to get it,
but the Martin darted after it and threw it to the Bat, who was flying
near the ground, and by his dodging and doubling kept it out of the way
of even the Deer, until he finally threw it in between the posts and
won the game for the birds.</p>
<p>The Bear and the Terrapin, who had boasted so of what they would do,
never got a chance even to touch the ball. For saving the ball when it
dropped, the birds afterwards gave the Martin a gourd in which to build
his nest, and he still has it.</p>

<h4 class="main">37. HOW THE TURKEY GOT HIS BEARD</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the Terrapin won the race from the Rabbit (see
the story) all the animals wondered and talked about it a great deal,
because they had always thought the Terrapin slow, although they knew
that he was a warrior and had many conjuring secrets beside. But the
Turkey was not satisfied and told the others there must be some trick
about it. Said he, &ldquo;I know the Terrapin can&rsquo;t run&mdash;he
can hardly crawl&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going to try him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So one day the Turkey met the Terrapin coming home from war with a
fresh scalp hanging from his neck and dragging on the ground as he
traveled. The Turkey laughed at the sight and said: &ldquo;That
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>scalp don&rsquo;t look right on you. Your neck
is too short and low down to wear it that way. Let me show
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Terrapin agreed and gave the scalp to the Turkey, who fastened
it around his neck. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Turkey,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk a little way and you can see how it
looks.&rdquo; So he walked ahead a short distance and then turned and
asked the Terrapin how he liked it. Said the Terrapin, &ldquo;It looks
very nice; it becomes you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll fix it in a different way and let you see how
it looks,&rdquo; said the Turkey. So he gave the string another pull
and walked ahead again. &ldquo;O, that looks very nice,&rdquo; said the
Terrapin. But the Turkey kept on walking, and when the Terrapin called
to him to bring back the scalp he only walked faster and broke into a
run. Then the Terrapin got out his bow and by his conjuring art shot a
number of cane splints into the Turkey&rsquo;s leg to cripple him so
that he could not run, which accounts for all the many small bones in
the Turkey&rsquo;s leg, that are of no use whatever; but the Terrapin
never caught the Turkey, who still wears the scalp from his neck.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Grouse used to have a fine voice and a good halloo
in the ballplay. All the animals and birds used to play ball in those
days and were just as proud of a loud halloo as the ball players of
to-day. The Turkey had not a good voice, so he asked the Grouse to give
him lessons. The Grouse agreed to teach him, but wanted pay for his
trouble, and the Turkey promised to give him some feathers to make
himself a collar. That is how the Grouse got his collar of turkey
feathers. They began the lessons and the Turkey learned very fast until
the Grouse thought it was time to try his voice. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo;
said the Grouse, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand on this hollow log, and when I
give the signal by tapping on it, you must halloo as loudly as you
can.&rdquo; So he got upon the log ready to tap on it, as a Grouse
does, but when he gave the signal the Turkey was so eager and excited
that he could not raise his voice for a shout, but only gobbled, and
ever since then he gobbles whenever he hears a noise.</p>

<h4 class="main">39. HOW THE KINGFISHER GOT HIS BILL</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some old men say that the Kingfisher was meant in the
beginning to be a water bird, but as he had not been given either web
feet or a good bill he could not make a living. The animals held a
council over it and decided to make him a bill like a long sharp awl
for a fish-gig (fish-spear). So they made him a fish-gig and fastened
it on in front of his mouth. He flew to the top of a tree, sailed out
and darted down into the water, and came up with a fish on his gig. And
he has been the best gigger ever since.</p>
<p>Some others say it was this way: A Blacksnake found a
Yellowhammer&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289"
name="pb289">289</a>]</span>nest in a hollow tree, and after swallowing
the young birds, coiled up to sleep in the nest, where the mother bird
found him when she came home. She went for help to the Little People,
who sent her to the Kingfisher. He came, and after flying back and
forth past the hole a few times, made one dart at the snake and pulled
him out dead. When they looked they found a hole in the snake&rsquo;s
head where the Kingfisher had pierced it with a slender
<i>tug&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;n&#259;</i> fish, which he carried in his
bill like a lance. From this the Little People concluded that he would
make a first-class gigger if he only had the right spear, so they gave
him his long bill as a reward.</p>

<p class="first">In the old days the Terrapin had a fine whistle, but
the Partridge had none. The Terrapin was constantly going about
whistling and showing his whistle to the other animals until the
Partridge became jealous, so one day when they met the Partridge asked
leave to try it. The Terrapin was afraid to risk it at first,
suspecting some trick, but the Partridge said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give
it back right away, and if you are afraid you can stay with me while I
practice.&rdquo; So the Terrapin let him have the whistle and the
Partridge walked around blowing on it in fine fashion. &ldquo;How does
it sound with me?&rdquo; asked the Partridge. &ldquo;O, you do very
well,&rdquo; said the Terrapin, walking alongside. &ldquo;Now, how do
you like it,&rdquo; said the Partridge, running ahead and whistling a
little faster. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; answered the Terrapin,
hurrying to keep up, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t run so fast.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And now, how do you like this?&rdquo; called the Partridge, and
with that he spread his wings, gave one long whistle, and flew to the
top of a tree, leaving the poor Terrapin to look after him from the
ground. The Terrapin never recovered his whistle, and from that, and
the loss of his scalp, which the Turkey stole from him, he grew ashamed
to be seen, and ever since he shuts himself up in his box when anyone
comes near him.</p>

out on a limb overhanging the water. When the Wolf arrived he saw the
reflection in the water, and thinking it was the Raccoon he jumped at
it and was nearly drowned before he could scramble out again, all wet

he was sleeping the Raccoon came down the tree and plastered his eyes
with dung. When the Wolf awoke he found he could not open his eyes, and
began to whine. Along came a little brown bird through the bushes and
heard the Wolf crying and asked what was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

mortar in front of the house. &ldquo;I can do that, too,&rdquo; said
he, but the woman would not believe it, so the Pheasant went into the
woods and got upon a hollow log and &ldquo;drummed&rdquo; with his
wings as a pheasant does, until the people in the house heard him and

<hr class="tb">
<p>In the Pheasant dance, a part of the Green-corn dance, the
instrument used is the drum, and the dancers beat the ground with their
feet in imitation of the drumming sound made by the pheasant. They form
two concentric circles, the men being on the inside, facing the women
in the outer circle, each in turn advancing and retreating at the
signal of the drummer, who sits at one side and sings the Pheasant
songs. According to the story, there was once a winter famine among the
birds and animals. No mast (fallen nuts) could be found in the woods,
and they were near starvation when a Pheasant discovered a holly tree,
loaded with red berries, of which the Pheasant is said to be
particularly fond. He called his companion birds, and they formed a
circle about the tree, singing, dancing, and drumming with their wings
in token of their joy, and thus originated the Pheasant dance.</p>

pretty woman. She preferred the Hummingbird, who was as handsome as the
Crane was awkward, but the Crane was so persistent that in order to get
rid of him she finally told him he must challenge the other to a race
and she would marry the winner. The Hummingbird was so
swift&mdash;almost like a flash of lightning&mdash;and the Crane so
slow and heavy, that she felt sure the Hummingbird would win. She did
not know the Crane could fly all night.</p>
<p>They agreed to start from her house and fly around the circle of the
world to the beginning, and the one who came in first would marry the
woman. At the word the Hummingbird darted off like an arrow and was out

creek and there found the Crane spearing tadpoles, with his long bill,
for breakfast. He was very much surprised and wondered how this could
have happened, but he flew swiftly by and soon left the Crane out of

<p>The Crane finished his breakfast and started on, and when evening

a little more, and on the fourth day he was spearing tadpoles for
dinner when the Hummingbird passed him. On the fifth and sixth days it
was late in the afternoon before the Hummingbird came up, and on the
morning of the seventh day the Crane was a whole night&rsquo;s travel
ahead. He took his time at breakfast and then fixed himself up as
nicely as he could at the creek and came in at the starting place where
the woman lived, early in the morning. When the Hummingbird arrived in
the afternoon he found he had lost the race, but the woman declared she
would never have such an ugly fellow as the Crane for a husband, so she

<p class="first">A widow with one daughter was always warning the girl
that she must be sure to get a good hunter for a husband when she
married. The young woman listened and promised to do as her mother
advised. At last a suitor came to ask the mother for the girl, but the
widow told him that only a good hunter could have her daughter.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just that kind,&rdquo; said the lover, and again asked
her to speak for him to the young woman. So the mother went to the girl
and told her a young man had come a-courting, and as he said he was a
good hunter she advised her daughter to take him. &ldquo;Just as you
say,&rdquo; said the girl. So when he came again the matter was all
arranged, and he went to live with the girl.</p>
<p>The next morning he got ready and said he would go out hunting, but
before starting he changed his mind and said he would go fishing. He
was gone all day and came home late at night, bringing only three small
fish, saying that he had had no luck, but would have better success
to-morrow. The next morning he started off again to fish and was gone
all day, but came home at night with only two worthless spring lizards
(<i>duw&#277;&prime;g&#259;</i>) and the same excuse. Next day he said
he would go hunting this time. He was gone again until night, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=

that he had found where some hunters had cut up a deer.</p>
<p>By this time the old woman was suspicious. So next morning when he
started off again, as he said, to fish, she told her daughter to follow
him secretly and see how he set to work. The girl followed through the
woods and kept him in sight until he came down to the river, where she
saw her husband change to a hooting owl (<i>uguku&prime;</i>) and fly
over to a pile of driftwood in the water and cry, &ldquo;<i>U-gu-ku!
hu! hu! u! u!</i>&rdquo; She was surprised and very angry and said to
herself, &ldquo;I thought I had married a man, but my husband is only
an owl.&rdquo; She watched and saw the owl look into the water for a
long time and at last swoop down and bring up in his claws a handful of
sand, from which he picked out a crawfish. Then he flew across to the
bank, took the form of a man again, and started home with the crawfish.
His wife hurried on ahead through the woods and got there before him.
When he came in with the crawfish in his hand, she asked him where were
all the fish he had caught. He said he had none, because an owl had
frightened them all away. &ldquo;I think you are the owl,&rdquo; said
his wife, and drove him out of the house. The owl went into the woods
and there he pined away with grief and love until there was no flesh
left on any part of his body except his head.</p>

him out to the cornfield. When breakfast was ready she went to call
him, following a sound as of some one hoeing on stony soil, but when
she came to the spot she found only a small circle of hoed ground and
no sign of her son-in-law. Away over in the thicket she heard a huhu
calling.</p>
<p>He did not come in for dinner, either, and when he returned home in
the evening the old woman asked him where he had been all day.
&ldquo;Hard at work,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t see you
when I came to call you to breakfast.&rdquo; &ldquo;I was down in the
thicket cutting sticks to mark off the field,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you come in to dinner?&rdquo; &ldquo;I was
too busy working,&rdquo; said he. So the old woman was satisfied, and
they had their supper together. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293"
href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span></p>
<p>Early next morning he started off with his hoe over his shoulder.
When breakfast was ready the old woman went again to call him, but
found no sign of him, only the hoe lying there and no work done. And
away over in the thicket a huhu was calling, &ldquo;<i>Sau-h! sau-h!
sau-h! hu! hu! hu! hu! hu! hu! chi! chi!
chi!&mdash;whew!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went back to the house, and when at last he came home in the
evening she asked him again what he had been doing all day.
&ldquo;Working hard,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But you were not there when
I came after you.&rdquo; &ldquo;O, I just went over in the thicket a
while to see some of my kinsfolk,&rdquo; said he. Then the old woman
said, &ldquo;I have lived here a long time and there is nothing living
in the swamp but huhus. My daughter wants a husband that can work and
not a lazy huhu; so you may go.&rdquo; And she drove him from the
house.</p>

<p class="first">The buzzard used to have a fine topknot, of which he
was so proud that he refused to eat carrion, and while the other birds
were pecking at the body of a deer or other animal which they had found
he would strut around and say: &ldquo;You may have it all, it is not
good enough for me.&rdquo; They resolved to punish him, and with the
help of the buffalo carried out a plot by which the buzzard lost not
his topknot alone, but nearly all the other feathers on his head. He
lost his pride at the same time, so that he is willing enough now to
eat carrion for a living.</p>

<p class="first">Once a hunter in the mountains heard a noise at night
like a rushing wind outside the cabin, and on going out he found that
an eagle had just alighted on the drying pole and was tearing at the
body of a deer hanging there. Without thinking of the danger, he shot
the eagle. In the morning he took the deer and started back to the
settlement, where he told what he had done, and the chief sent out some
men to bring in the eagle and arrange for an Eagle dance. They brought
back the dead eagle, everything was made ready, and that night they
started the dance in the townhouse.</p>
<p>About midnight there was a whoop outside and a strange warrior came
into the circle and began to recite his exploits. No one knew him, but
they thought he had come from one of the farther Cherokee towns. He
told how he had killed a man, and at the end of the story he gave a
hoarse yell, <i>Hi!</i> that startled the whole company, and one of the
seven men with the rattles fell over dead. He sang of another deed, and
at the end straightened up with another loud yell. A second rattler
fell dead, and the people were so full of fear that they could not stir
from their places. Still he kept on, and at every pause there came
again that terrible scream, until the last of the seven rattlers fell
dead, and then the stranger went out into the darkness. Long afterward

<h4 class="main">48. THE HUNTER AND THE BUZZARD</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A hunter had been all day looking for deer in the
mountains without success until he was completely tired out and sat
down on a log to rest and wonder what he should do, when a
buzzard&mdash;a bird which always has magic powers&mdash;came flying
overhead and spoke to him, asking him what was his trouble. When the
hunter had told his story the buzzard said there were plenty of deer on
the ridges beyond if only the hunter were high up in the air where he
could see them, and proposed that they exchange forms for a while, when
the buzzard would go home to the hunter&rsquo;s wife while the hunter
would go to look for deer. The hunter agreed, and the buzzard became a
man and went home to the hunter&rsquo;s wife, who received him as her
husband, while the hunter became a buzzard and flew off over the
mountain to locate the deer. After staying some time with the woman,
who thought always it was her real husband, the buzzard excused
himself, saying he must go again to look for game or they would have
nothing to eat. He came to the place where he had first met the hunter,
and found him already there, still in buzzard form, awaiting him. He
asked the hunter what success he had had, and the hunter replied that
he had found several deer over the ridge, as the buzzard had said. Then
the buzzard restored the hunter to human shape, and became himself a
buzzard again and flew away. The hunter went where he had seen the deer
and killed several, and from that time he never returned empty-handed
from the woods.</p>

<h4 class="main">49. THE SNAKE TRIBE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The generic name for snakes is
<i>in&#259;d&ucirc;&prime;</i>. They are all regarded as
<i>anida&prime;weh&#301;</i>, &ldquo;supernaturals,&rdquo; having an
intimate connection with the rain and thunder gods, and possessing a
certain influence over the other animal and plant tribes. It is said
that the snakes, the deer, and the ginseng act as allies, so that an
injury to one is avenged by all. The feeling toward snakes is one of
mingled fear and reverence, and every precaution is taken to avoid
killing or offending one, especially the rattlesnake. He who kills a
snake will soon see others; and should he kill a second one, so many
will come around him whichever way he may turn that he will become
dazed at the sight of their glistening eyes and darting tongues and
will go wandering about like a crazy man, unable to find his way out of
the woods. To guard against this misfortune there are certain prayers
which the initiated say in order that a snake may not cross their path,
and on meeting the first one of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>season the hunter
humbly begs of him, &ldquo;Let us not see each other this
summer.&rdquo; Certain smells, as that of the wild parsnip, and certain
songs, as those of the <i>Unika&prime;w&#301;</i> or Townhouse dance,
are offensive to the snakes and make them angry. For this reason the
Unika&prime;w&#301; dance is held only late in the fall, after they
have retired to their dens for the winter.</p>
<p>When one dreams of being bitten by a snake he must be treated the
same as for an actual bite, because it is a snake ghost that has bitten
him; otherwise the place will swell and ulcerate in the same way, even
though it be years afterwards. For fear of offending them, even in
speaking, it is never said that a man has been bitten by a snake, but
only that he has been &ldquo;scratched by a brier.&rdquo; Most of the
beliefs and customs in this connection have more special reference to
the rattlesnake.</p>
<p>The rattlesnake is called <i>utsa&prime;n&#259;t&#301;</i>, which
may be rendered, &ldquo;he has a bell,&rdquo; alluding to the rattle.
According to a myth given elsewhere, he was once a man, and was
transformed to his present shape that he might save the human race from
extermination by the Sun, a mission which he accomplished successfully
after others had failed. By the old men he is also spoken of as
&ldquo;the Thunder&rsquo;s necklace&rdquo; (see the story of
&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime;), and to kill one is to destroy one
of the most prized ornaments of the thunder god. In one of the formulas
addressed to the Little Men, the sons of the Thunder, they are implored
to take the disease snake to themselves, because &ldquo;it is just what
you adorn yourselves with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For obvious reasons the rattlesnake is regarded as the chief of the
snake tribe and is feared and respected accordingly. Few Cherokee will
venture to kill one except under absolute necessity, and even then the
crime must be atoned for by asking pardon of the snake ghost, either in
person or through the mediation of a priest, according to a set
formula. Otherwise the relatives of the dead snake will send one of
their number to track up the offender and bite him so that he will die
(see story, &ldquo;The Rattlesnake&rsquo;s Vengeance&rdquo;). The only
thing of which the rattlesnake is afraid is said to be the plant known
as campion, or &ldquo;rattlesnake&rsquo;s master&rdquo; (<i lang=
"la">Silene stellata</i>), which is used by the doctors to counteract
the effect of the bite, and it is believed that a snake will flee in
terror from the hunter who carries a small piece of the root about his
person. Chewed linn bark is also applied to the bite, perhaps from the
supposed occult connection between the snake and the thunder, as this
tree is said to be immune from the lightning stroke.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fear of the rattlesnake, his rattles, teeth,
flesh, and oil are greatly prized for occult or medical uses, the
snakes being killed for this purpose by certain priests who know the
necessary rites and formulas for obtaining pardon. This device for
whipping the devil around the stump, and incidentally increasing their
own revenues, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>is a common trick of Indian medicine men.
Outsiders desiring to acquire this secret knowledge are discouraged by
being told that it is a dangerous thing to learn, for the reason that
the new initiate is almost certain to be bitten, in order that the
snakes may &ldquo;try&rdquo; him to know if he has correctly learned
the formula. When a rattlesnake is killed the head must be cut off and
buried an arm&rsquo;s length deep in the ground and the body carefully
hidden away in a hollow log. If it is left exposed to the weather, the
angry snakes will send such torrents of rain that all the streams will
overflow their banks. Moreover, they will tell their friends, the deer,
and the ginseng in the mountains, so that these will hide themselves
and the hunters will seek them in vain.</p>
<p>The tooth of a rattlesnake which has been killed by the priest with
the proper ceremonies while the snake was lying stretched out from east
to west is used to scarify patients preliminary to applying the
medicine in certain ailments. Before using it the doctor holds it
between the thumb and finger of his right hand and addresses it in a
prayer, at the end of which the tooth &ldquo;becomes alive,&rdquo; when
it is ready for the operation. The explanation is that the tense,
nervous grasp of the doctor causes his hand to twitch and the tooth to
move slightly between his fingers. The rattles are worn on the head,
and sometimes a portion of the flesh is eaten by ball players to make
them more terrible to their opponents, but it is said to have the bad
effect of making them cross to their wives. From the lower half of the
body, thought to be the fattest portion, the oil is extracted and is in
as great repute among the Indians for rheumatism and sore joints as
among the white mountaineers. The doctor who prepares the oil must also
eat the flesh of the snake. In certain seasons of epidemic a roasted
(barbecued) rattlesnake was kept hanging up in the house, and every
morning the father of the family bit off a small piece and chewed it,
mixing it then with water, which he spit upon the bodies of the others
to preserve them from the contagion. It was said to be a sure cure, but
apt to make the patients hot tempered.</p>
<p>The copperhead, <i>w&acirc;&prime;dige-ask&acirc;&prime;l&#301;</i>,
&ldquo;brown-head,&rdquo; although feared on account of its poisonous
bite, is hated, instead of being regarded with veneration, as is the
rattlesnake. It is believed to be a descendant of a great mythic
serpent (see <a href="#s5">number 5</a>) and is said to have
&ldquo;eyes of fire,&rdquo; on account of their intense brightness. The
blacksnake is called <i>g&ucirc;le&prime;g&#301;</i>, &ldquo;the
climber.&rdquo; Biting its body is said to be a preventive of
toothache, and there is also a belief, perhaps derived from the whites,
that if the body of one be hung upon a tree it will bring rain within
three (four?) days. The small greensnake is called
<i>s&#259;likw&acirc;&prime;y&#301;</i>, the same name being also
applied to a certain plant, the <i>Eryngium virginianum</i>, or bear
grass, whose long, slender leaves bear some resemblance to a
greensnake. As with the blacksnake, it is believed that toothache may
be prevented and sound teeth insured as long as life lasts by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>biting the greensnake along its body. It must be
held by the head and tail, and all the teeth at once pressed down four
times along the middle of its body, but without biting into the flesh
or injuring the snake. Some informants say that the operation must be
repeated four times upon as many snakes and that a certain food tabu
must also be observed. The water moccasin,
<i>kanegw&acirc;&prime;t&#301;</i>, is not specially regarded, but a
very rare wood snake, said to resemble it except that it has blue eyes,
is considered to have great supernatural powers, in what way is not
specified. The repulsive but harmless spreading adder
(<i>Heterodon</i>) is called <i>dal&#301;kst&#259;&prime;</i>,
&ldquo;vomiter,&rdquo; on account of its habit of spitting, and
sometimes <i>kwand&#259;ya&prime;h&ucirc;</i>, a word of uncertain
etymology. It was formerly a man, but was transformed into a snake in
order to accomplish the destruction of the Daughter of the Sun (see the
story). For its failure on this occasion it is generally despised.</p>
<p>The Wahnenauhi manuscript mentions a legend of a great serpent
called on account of its color the &ldquo;ground snake.&rdquo; To see
it was an omen of death to the one who saw it, and if it was seen by
several persons some great tribal calamity was expected. For traditions
and beliefs in regard to the Uktena, the Uksuh&#301;, and other mythic
serpents, see under those headings.</p>

<h4 class="main">50. THE UKTENA AND THE
UL&Ucirc;&Ntilde;S&Ucirc;&prime;T&#300;</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago&mdash;<i>h&#301;lahi&prime;yu</i>&mdash;when
the Sun became angry at the people on earth and sent a sickness to
destroy them, the Little Men changed a man into a monster snake, which
they called Uktena, &ldquo;The Keen-eyed,&rdquo; and sent him to kill
her. He failed to do the work, and the Rattlesnake had to be sent
instead, which made the Uktena so jealous and angry that the people
were afraid of him and had him taken up to
G&#259;l&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;l&#259;t&#301;, to stay with the other
dangerous things.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9239src" href="#xd25e9239"
name="xd25e9239src">1</a> He left others behind him, though, nearly as
large and dangerous as himself, and they hide now in deep pools in the
river and about lonely passes in the high mountains, the places which
the Cherokee call &ldquo;Where the Uktena stays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who know say that the Uktena is a great snake, as large around
as a tree trunk, with horns on its head, and a bright, blazing crest
like a diamond upon its forehead, and scales glittering like sparks of
fire. It has rings or spots of color along its whole length, and can
not be wounded except by shooting in the seventh spot from the head,
because under this spot are its heart and its life. The blazing diamond
is called <i>Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301;</i>,
&ldquo;Transparent,&rdquo; and he who can win it may become the
greatest wonder worker of the tribe, but it is worth a man&rsquo;s life
to attempt it, for whoever is seen by the Uktena is so dazed by the
bright light that he runs toward the snake instead of trying to escape.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>Even to see the Uktena asleep is death, not to
the hunter himself, but to <i>his family</i>.</p>
<p>Of all the daring warriors who have started out in search of the
Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301; only
&Acirc;g&#259;n-uni&prime;ts&#301; ever came back successful.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e9254src" href="#xd25e9254" name="xd25e9254src">2</a>
The East Cherokee still keep the one which he brought. It is like a
large transparent crystal, nearly the shape of a cartridge bullet, with
a blood-red streak running through the center from top to bottom. The
owner keeps it wrapped in a whole deerskin, inside an earthen jar
hidden away in a secret cave in the mountains. Every seven days he
feeds it with the blood of small game, rubbing the blood all over the
crystal as soon as the animal has been killed. Twice a year it must
have the blood of a deer or some other large animal. Should he forget
to feed it at the proper time it would come out from its cave at night
in a shape of fire and fly through the air to slake its thirst with the
lifeblood of the conjurer or some one of his people. He may save
himself from this danger by telling it, when he puts it away, that he
will not need it again for a long time. It will then go quietly to
sleep and feel no hunger until it is again brought out to be consulted.
Then it must be fed again with blood before it is used.</p>
<p>No white man must ever see it and no person but the owner will
venture near it for fear of sudden death. Even the conjurer who keeps
it is afraid of it, and changes its hiding place every once in a while
so that it can not learn the way out. When he dies it will be buried
with him. Otherwise it will come out of its cave, like a blazing star,
to search for his grave, night after night for seven years, when, if
still not able to find him, it will go back to sleep forever where he
has placed it.</p>
<p>Whoever owns the Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301; is sure of
success in hunting, love, rain-making, and every other business, but
its great use is in life prophecy. When it is consulted for this
purpose the future is seen mirrored in the clear crystal as a tree is
reflected in the quiet stream below, and the conjurer knows whether the
sick man will recover, whether the warrior will return from battle, or
whether the youth will live to be old.</p>

<h4 class="main">51. &Acirc;G&#258;N-UNI&prime;TS&#300;&rsquo;S SEARCH
FOR THE UKTENA</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In one of their battles with the Shawano, who are all
magicians, the Cherokee captured a great medicine-man whose name was
&Acirc;g&#259;n-uni&prime;ts&#301;, &ldquo;The Ground-hogs&rsquo;
Mother.&rdquo; They had tied him ready for the torture when he begged
for his life and engaged, if spared, to find for them the great wonder
worker, the Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301;. Now, the
Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301; is like a blazing star set in
the forehead of the great Uktena serpent, and the medicine-man who
could possess it might do marvelous things, but everyone knew this
could not be, because it was certain death to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>meet
the Uktena. They warned him of all this, but he only answered that his
medicine was strong and he was not afraid. So they gave him his life on
that condition and he began the search.</p>
<p>The Uktena used to lie in wait in lonely places to surprise its
victims, and especially haunted the dark passes of the Great Smoky
mountains. Knowing this, the magician went first to a gap in the range
on the far northern border of the Cherokee country. He searched and
found there a monster blacksnake, larger than had ever been known
before, but it was not what he was looking for, and he laughed at it as
something too small for notice. Coming southward to the next gap he
found there a great moccasin snake, the largest ever seen, but when the
people wondered he said it was nothing. In the next gap he found a
greensnake and called the people to see &ldquo;the pretty
s&#259;likw&acirc;&prime;y&#301;,&rdquo; but when they found an immense
greensnake coiled up in the path they ran away in fear. Coming on to
U&prime;t&#259;wag&ucirc;n&prime;ta, the Bald mountain, he found there
a great diya&prime;h&#259;l&#301; (lizard) basking, but, although it
was large and terrible to look at, it was not what he wanted and he
paid no attention to it. Going still south to
Wal&acirc;si&prime;y&#301;, the Frog place, he found a great frog
squatting in the gap, but when the people who came to see it were
frightened like the others and ran away from the monster he mocked at
them for being afraid of a frog and went on to the next gap. He went on
to Duniskwa&#699;lg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, the Gap of the Forked
Antler, and to the enchanted lake of Atag&acirc;&prime;h&#301;, and at
each he found monstrous reptiles, but he said they were nothing. He
thought the Uktena might be hiding in the deep water at
Tlanusi&prime;y&#301;, the Leech place, on Hiwassee, where other
strange things had been seen before, and going there he dived far down
under the surface. He saw turtles and water snakes, and two immense
sun-perches rushed at him and retreated again, but that was all. Other
places he tried, going always southward, and at last on
Gah&ucirc;&prime;t&#301; mountain he found the Uktena asleep.</p>
<p>Turning without noise, he ran swiftly down the mountain side as far
as he could go with one long breath, nearly to the bottom of the slope.
There he stopped and piled up a great circle of pine cones, and inside
of it he dug a deep trench. Then he set fire to the cones and came back
again up the mountain.</p>
<p>The Uktena was still asleep, and, putting an arrow to his bow,
&Acirc;g&#259;n-uni&prime;ts&#301; shot and sent the arrow through its
heart, which was under the seventh spot from the serpent&rsquo;s head.
The great snake raised his head, with the diamond in front flashing
fire, and came straight at his enemy, but the magician, turning
quickly, ran at full speed down the mountain, cleared the circle of
fire and the trench at one bound, and lay down on the ground
inside.</p>
<p>The Uktena tried to follow, but the arrow was through his
heart<span class="corr" id="xd25e9276" title="Source: .">,</span> and
in another moment he rolled over in his death struggle, spitting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>poison over all the mountain side. But the
poison drops could not pass the circle of fire, but only hissed and
sputtered in the blaze, and the magician on the inside was untouched
except by one small drop which struck upon his head as he lay close to
the ground; but he did not know it. The blood, too, as poisonous as the
froth, poured from the Uktena&rsquo;s wound and down the slope in a
dark stream, but it ran into the trench and left him unharmed. The
dying monster rolled over and over down the mountain, breaking down
large trees in its path until it reached the bottom. Then
&Acirc;g&#259;n-uni&prime;ts&#301; called every bird in all the woods
to come to the feast, and so many came that when they were done not
even the bones were left.</p>
<p>After seven days he went by night to the spot. The body and the
bones of the snake were gone, all eaten by the birds, but he saw a
bright light shining in the darkness, and going over to it he found,
resting on a low-hanging branch, where a raven had dropped it, the
diamond from the head of the Uktena. He wrapped it up carefully and
took it with him, and from that time he became the greatest
medicine-man in the whole tribe.</p>
<p>When &Acirc;g&#259;n-uni&prime;ts&#301; came down again to the
settlement the people noticed a small snake hanging from his head where
the single drop of poison from the Uktena had struck; but so long as he
lived he himself never knew that it was there.</p>
<p>Where the blood of the Uktena had filled the trench a lake formed
afterwards, and the water was black and in this water the women used to
dye the cane splits for their baskets.</p>

<h4 class="main">52. THE RED MAN AND THE UKTENA</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Two brothers went hunting together, and when they came
to a good camping place in the mountains they made a fire, and while
one gathered bark to put up a shelter the other started up the creek to
look for a deer. Soon he heard a noise on the top of the ridge as if
two animals were fighting. He hurried through the bushes to see what it
might be, and when he came to the spot he found a great uktena coiled
around a man and choking him to death. The man was fighting for his
life, and called out to the hunter: &ldquo;Help me, nephew; he is your
enemy as well as mine.&rdquo; The hunter took good aim, and, drawing
the arrow to the head, sent it through the body of the uktena, so that
the blood spouted from the hole. The snake loosed its coils with a
snapping noise, and went tumbling down the ridge into the valley,
tearing up the earth like a water spout as it rolled.</p>
<p>The stranger stood up, and it was the Asga&prime;ya
Gi&prime;g&#259;ge&#301;, the Red Man of the Lightning. He said to the
hunter: &ldquo;You have helped me, and now I will reward you, and give
you a medicine so that you can always find game.&rdquo; They waited
until it was dark, and then went down the ridge to where the dead
uktena had rolled, but by this time <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>the birds and insects
had eaten the body and only the bones were left. In one place were
flashes of light coming up from the ground, and on digging here, just
under the surface, the Red Man found a scale of the uktena. Next he
went over to a tree that had been struck by lightning, and gathering a
handful of splinters he made a fire and burned the uktena scale to a
coal. He wrapped this in a piece of deerskin and gave it to the hunter,
saying: &ldquo;As long as you keep this you can always kill
game.&rdquo; Then he told the hunter that when he went back to camp he
must hang up the medicine on a tree outside, because it was very strong
and dangerous. He told him also that when he went into the cabin he
would find his brother lying inside nearly dead on account of the
presence of the uktena&rsquo;s scale, but he must take a small piece of
cane, which the Red Man gave him, and scrape a little of it into water
and give it to his brother to drink and he would be well again. Then
the Red Man was gone, and the hunter could not see where he went. He
returned to camp alone, and found his brother very sick, but soon cured
him with the medicine from the cane, and that day and the next, and
every day after, he found game whenever he went for it.</p>

<h4 class="main">53. THE HUNTER AND THE UKSU&prime;H&#300;</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A man living down in Georgia came to visit some
relatives at Hickory-log. He was a great hunter, and after resting in
the house a day or two got ready to go into the mountains. His friends
warned him not to go toward the north, as in that direction, near a
certain large uprooted tree, there lived a dangerous monster
uksu&prime;h&#301; snake. It kept constant watch, and whenever it could
spring upon an unwary hunter it would coil about him and crush out his
life in its folds and then drag the dead body down the mountain side
into a deep hole in Hiwassee.</p>
<p>He listened quietly to the warning, but all they said only made him
the more anxious to see such a monster, so, without saying anything of
his intention, he left the settlement and took his way directly up the
mountain toward the north. Soon he came to the fallen tree and climbed
upon the trunk, and there, sure enough, on the other side was the great
uksu&prime;h&#301; stretched out in the grass, with its head raised,
but looking the other way. It was about so large [making a circle of a
foot in diameter with his hands]. The frightened hunter got down again
at once and started to run; but the snake had heard the noise and
turned quickly and was after him. Up the ridge the hunter ran, the
snake close behind him, then down the other side toward the river. With
all his running the uksu&prime;h&#301; gained rapidly, and just as he
reached the low ground it caught up with him and wrapped around him,
pinning one arm down by his side, but leaving the other free.</p>
<p>Now it gave him a terrible squeeze that almost broke his ribs, and
then began to drag him along toward the water. With his free hand
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>the hunter clutched at the bushes as they
passed, but the snake turned its head and blew its sickening breath
into his face until he had to let go his hold. Again and again this
happened, and all the time they were getting nearer to a deep hole in
the river, when, almost at the last moment, a lucky thought came into
the hunter&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>He was sweating all over from his hard run across the mountain, and
suddenly remembered to have heard that snakes can not bear the smell of
perspiration. Putting his free hand into his bosom he worked it around
under his armpit until it was covered with perspiration. Then
withdrawing it he grasped at a bush until the snake turned its head,
when he quickly slapped his sweaty hand on its nose. The
uksu&prime;h&#301; gave one gasp almost as if it had been wounded,
loosened its coil, and glided swiftly away through the bushes, leaving
the hunter, bruised but not disabled, to make his way home to
Hickory-log.</p>

<h4 class="main">54. THE UST&Ucirc;&prime;TL&#300;</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a great serpent called the
Ust&ucirc;&prime;tl&#301; that made its haunt upon Cohutta mountain. It
was called the Ust&ucirc;&prime;tl&#301; or &ldquo;foot&rdquo; snake,
because it did not glide like other snakes, but had feet at each end of
its body, and moved by strides or jerks, like a great measuring worm.
These feet were three-cornered and flat and could hold on to the ground
like suckers. It had no legs, but would raise itself up on its hind
feet, with its snaky head waving high in the air until it found a good
place to take a fresh hold; then it would bend down and grip its front
feet to the ground while it drew its body up from behind. It could
cross rivers and deep ravines by throwing its head across and getting a
grip with its front feet and then swinging its body over. Wherever its
footprints were found there was danger. It used to bleat like a young
fawn, and when the hunter heard a fawn bleat in the woods he never
looked for it, but hurried away in the other direction. Up the mountain
or down, nothing could escape the Ust&ucirc;&prime;tl&#301;&rsquo;s
pursuit, but along the side of the ridge it could not go, because the
great weight of its swinging head broke its hold on the ground when it
moved sideways.</p>
<p>It came to pass after a while that not a hunter about Cohutta would
venture near the mountain for dread of the Ust&ucirc;&prime;tl&#301;.
At last a man from one of the northern settlements came down to visit
some relatives in that neighborhood. When he arrived they made a feast
for him, but had only corn and beans, and excused themselves for having
no meat because the hunters were afraid to go into the mountains. He
asked the reason, and when they told him he said he would go himself
to-morrow and either bring in a deer or find the
Ust&ucirc;&prime;tl&#301;. They tried to dissuade him from it, but as
he insisted upon going they warned him that if he heard a fawn bleat in
the thicket he must run at once and if the snake came after him he must
not try to run down the mountain, but along the side of the ridge.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the morning he started out and went directly toward the mountain.
Working his way through the bushes at the base, he suddenly heard a
fawn bleat in front. He guessed at once that it was the
Ust&ucirc;&prime;tl&#301;, but he had made up his mind to see it, so he
did not turn back, but went straight forward, and there, sure enough,
was the monster, with its great head in the air, as high as the pine
branches, looking in every direction to discover a deer, or maybe a
man, for breakfast. It saw him and came at him at once, moving in jerky
strides, every one the length of a tree trunk, holding its scaly head
high above the bushes and bleating as it came.</p>
<p>The hunter was so badly frightened that he lost his wits entirely
and started to run directly up the mountain. The great snake came after
him, gaining half its length on him every time it took a fresh grip
with its fore feet, and would have caught the hunter before he reached
the top of the ridge, but that he suddenly remembered the warning and
changed his course to run along the sides of the mountain. At once the
snake began to lose ground, for every time it raised itself up the
weight of its body threw it out of a straight line and made it fall a
little lower down the side of the ridge. It tried to recover itself,
but now the hunter gained and kept on until he turned the end of the
ridge and left the snake out of sight. Then he cautiously climbed to
the top and looked over and saw the Ust&ucirc;&prime;tl&#301; still
slowly working its way toward the summit.</p>
<p>He went down to the base of the mountain, opened his fire pouch, and
set fire to the grass and leaves. Soon the fire ran all around the
mountain and began to climb upward. When the great snake smelled the
smoke and saw the flames coming it forgot all about the hunter and
turned to make all speed for a high cliff near the summit. It reached
the rock and got upon it, but the fire followed and caught the dead
pines about the base of the cliff until the heat made the
Ust&ucirc;&prime;tl&#301;&rsquo;s scales crack. Taking a close grip of
the rock with its hind feet it raised its body and put forth all its
strength in an effort to spring across the wall of fire that surrounded
it, but the smoke choked it and its hold loosened and it fell among the
blazing pine trunks and lay there until it was burned to ashes.</p>

in the old time a great snake called the
Uw&#700;ts&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;ta or &ldquo;bouncer,&rdquo; because it
moved by jerks like a measuring worm, with only one part of its body on
the ground at a time. It stayed generally on the east side, where the
sun came first in the morning, and used to cross by reaching over from
the highest point of the cliff until it could get a grip on the other
side, when it would pull <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href=
"#pb304" name="pb304">304</a>]</span>over the rest of its body. It was
so immense that when it was thus stretched across its shadow darkened
the whole valley below. For a long time the people did not know it was
there, but when at last they found out about it they were afraid to
live in the valley, so that it was deserted even while still Indian

<h4 class="main">56. THE SNAKE BOY</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a boy who used to go bird hunting every day,
and all the birds he brought home he gave to his grandmother, who was
very fond of him. This made the rest of the family jealous, and they
treated him in such fashion that at last one day he told his
grandmother he would leave them all, but that she must not grieve for
him. Next morning he refused to eat any breakfast, but went off hungry
to the woods and was gone all day. In the evening he returned, bringing
with him a pair of deer horns, and went directly to the hothouse
(&acirc;s&#301;), where his grandmother was waiting for him. He told
the old woman he must be alone that night, so she got up and went into
the house where the others were.</p>
<p>At early daybreak she came again to the hothouse and looked in, and
there she saw an immense uktena that filled the &acirc;s&#301;, with
horns on its head, but still with two human legs instead of a snake
tail. It was all that was left of her boy. He spoke to her and told her
to leave him, and she went away again from the door. When the sun was
well up, the uktena began slowly to crawl out, but it was full noon
before it was all out of the &acirc;s&#301;. It made a terrible hissing
noise as it came out, and all the people ran from it. It crawled on
through the settlement, leaving a broad trail in the ground behind it,
until it came to a deep bend in the river, where it plunged in and went
under the water.</p>
<p>The grandmother grieved much for her boy, until the others of the
family got angry and told her that as she thought -so much of him she
ought to go and stay with him. So she left them and went along the
trail made by the uktena to the river and walked directly into the
water and disappeared. Once after that a man fishing near the place saw
her sitting on a large rock in the river, looking just as she had
always looked, but as soon as she caught sight of him she jumped into
the water and was gone.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Two hunters, both for some reason under a tabu against
the meat of a squirrel or turkey, had gone into the woods together.
When evening came they found a good camping place and lighted a fire to
prepare their supper. One of them had killed several squirrels during
the day, and now got ready to broil them over the fire. His companion
warned him that if he broke the tabu and ate squirrel meat he would
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>become a snake, but the other laughed and said
that was only a conjurer&rsquo;s story. He went on with his
preparation, and when the squirrels were roasted made his supper of
them and then lay down beside the fire to sleep.</p>
<p>Late that night his companion was aroused by groaning, and on
looking around he found the other lying on the ground rolling and
twisting in agony, and with the lower part of his body already changed
to the body and tail of a large water snake. The man was still able to
speak and called loudly for help, but his companion could do nothing,
but only sit by and try to comfort him while he watched the arms sink
into the body and the skin take on a scaly change that mounted
gradually toward the neck, until at last even the head was a
serpent&rsquo;s head and the great snake crawled away from the fire and
down the bank into the river.</p>

<h4 class="main">58. THE RATTLESNAKE&rsquo;S VENGEANCE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day in the old times when we could still talk with
other creatures, while some children were playing about the house,
their mother inside heard them scream. Running out she found that a
rattlesnake had crawled from the grass, and taking up a stick she
killed it. The father was out hunting in the mountains, and that
evening when coming home after dark through the gap he heard a strange
wailing sound. Looking about he found that he had come into the midst
of a whole company of rattlesnakes, which all had their mouths open and
seemed to be crying. He asked them the reason of their trouble, and
they told him that his own wife had that day killed their chief, the
Yellow Rattlesnake, and they were just now about to send the Black
Rattlesnake to take revenge.</p>
<p>The hunter said he was very sorry, but they told him that if he
spoke the truth he must be ready to make satisfaction and give his wife
as a sacrifice for the life of their chief. Not knowing what might
happen otherwise, he consented. They then told him that the Black
Rattlesnake would go home with him and coil up just outside the door in
the dark. He must go inside, where he would find his wife awaiting him,
and ask her to get him a drink of fresh water from the spring. That was
all.</p>
<p>He went home and knew that the Black Rattlesnake was following. It
was night when he arrived and very dark, but he found his wife waiting
with his supper ready. He sat down and asked for a drink of water. She
handed him a gourd full from the jar, but he said he wanted it fresh
from the spring, so she took a bowl and went out of the door. The next
moment he heard a cry, and going out he found that the Black
Rattlesnake had bitten her and that she was already dying. He stayed
with her until she was dead, when the Black Rattlesnake came out from
the grass again and said his tribe was now satisfied. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>He
then taught the hunter a prayer song, and said, &ldquo;When you meet
any of us hereafter sing this song and we will not hurt you; but if by
accident one of us should bite one of your people then sing this song
over him and he will recover.&rdquo; And the Cherokee have kept the
song to this day.</p>

<h4 class="main">59. THE SMALLER REPTILES&mdash;FISHES AND INSECTS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are several varieties of frogs and toads, each
with a different name, but there is very little folklore in connection
with them. The common green frog is called
<i>wal&acirc;&prime;s&#301;</i>, and among the Cherokee, as among
uneducated whites, the handling of it is thought to cause warts, which
for this reason are called by the same name,
<i>wal&acirc;&prime;s&#301;</i>. A solar eclipse is believed to be
caused by the attempt of a great frog to swallow the sun, and in former
times it was customary on such occasions to fire guns and make other
loud noises to frighten away the frog. The smaller varieties are
sometimes eaten, and on rare occasions the bullfrog also, but the meat
is tabued to ball players while in training, for fear that the
brittleness of the frog&rsquo;s bones would be imparted to those of the
player.</p>
<p>The land tortoise (<i>t&ucirc;ks&#301;&prime;</i>) is prominent in
the animal myths, and is reputed to have been a great warrior in the
old times. On account of the stoutness of its legs ball players rub
their limbs with them before going into the contest. The common water
turtle (<i>s&#259;ligu&prime;g&#301;</i>), which occupies so important
a place in the mythology of the northern tribes, is not mentioned in
Cherokee myth or folklore, and the same is true of the soft-shelled
turtle (<i>u&#699;l&#259;n&#259;&prime;w&#259;</i>), perhaps for the
reason that both are rare in the cold mountain streams of the Cherokee
country.</p>
<p>There are perhaps half a dozen varieties of lizard, each with a
different name. The gray road lizard, or
<i>diy&acirc;&prime;h&#259;l&#301;</i> (alligator lizard, <i>Sceloporus
undulatus</i>), is the most common. On account of its habit of
alternately puffing out and drawing in its throat as though sucking,
when basking in the sun, it is invoked in the formulas for drawing out
the poison from snake bites. If one catches the first
diy&acirc;&prime;h&#259;l&#301; seen in the spring, and, holding it
between his fingers, scratches his legs downward with its claws, he
will see no dangerous snakes all summer. Also, if one be caught alive
at any time and rubbed over the head and throat of an infant,
scratching the skin very slightly at the same time with the claws, the
child will never be fretful, but will sleep quietly without
complaining, even when sick or exposed to the rain. This is a somewhat
risky experiment, however, as the child is liable thereafter to go to
sleep wherever it may be laid down for a moment, so that the mother is
in constant danger of losing it. According to some authorities this
sleep lizard is not the diy&acirc;&prime;h&#259;l&#301;, but a larger
variety akin to the next described.</p>
<p>The <i>gig&#259;-tsuha&prime;&#699;l&#301;</i> (&ldquo;bloody
mouth,&rdquo; <i>Pleistodon</i>?) is described as a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>very
large lizard, nearly as large as a water dog, with the throat and
corners of the mouth red, as though from drinking blood. It is believed
to be not a true lizard but a transformed
<i>ug&ucirc;&ntilde;ste&prime;l&#301;</i> fish (described below) on
account of the similarity of coloring and the fact that the fish
disappears about the time the gig&#259;-tsuha&prime;&#699;l&#301;
begins to come out. It is ferocious and a hard biter, and pursues other
lizards. In dry weather it cries or makes a noise like a cicada,
raising itself up as it cries. It has a habit of approaching near to
where some person is sitting or standing, then halting and looking
fixedly at him, and constantly puffing out its throat until its head
assumes a bright red color. It is thought then to be sucking the blood
of its victim, and is dreaded and shunned accordingly. The small
scorpion lizard (<i>ts&acirc;ne&prime;n&#301;</i>) is sometimes called
also <i>gig&#259;-danegi&prime;sk&#301;</i>, &ldquo;blood taker.&rdquo;
It is a striped lizard which frequents sandy beaches and resemble the
diy&acirc;&prime;h&#259;l&#301;, but is of a brown color. It is
believed also to be sucking blood in some mysterious way whenever it
nods its head, and if its heart be eaten by a dog that animal will be
able to extract all the nutrient properties from food by simply looking
at these who are eating.</p>
<p>The small spring lizard (<i>duw&#277;&prime;&#699;g&#259;</i>),
which lives in springs, is supposed to cause rain whenever it crawls
out of the spring. It is frequently invoked in the formulas. Another
spring (?) lizard, red, with black spots, is called
<i>d&#259;gan&prime;&#699;t&ucirc;&prime;</i> or
<i>aniganti&prime;sk&#301;</i> &ldquo;the rain maker,&rdquo; because
its cry is said to bring rain. The water dog (<i>tsuw&#259;&prime;</i>,
mud puppy, <i>Menopoma</i> or <i>Protonopsis</i>) is a very large
lizard, or rather salamander, frequenting muddy water. It is rarely
eaten, from an unexplained belief that if one who has eaten its meat
goes into the field immediately afterward the crop will be ruined.
There are names for one or two other varieties of lizard as well as for
the alligator (<i>tsula&prime;sk&#301;</i>), but no folklore in
connection with them.</p>
<p>Although the Cherokee country abounds in swift-flowing streams well
stocked with fish, of which the Indians make free use, there is but
little fish lore. A number of &ldquo;dream&rdquo; diseases, really due
to indigestion, are ascribed to revengeful fish ghosts, and the doctor
usually tries to effect the cure by invoking some larger fish or
fish-eating bird to drive out the ghost.</p>
<p>Toco creek, in Monroe county, Tennessee, derives its name from a
mythic monster fish, the D&#259;kw&#259;&prime;, considered the father
of all the fish tribe, which is said to have lived formerly in Little
Tennessee river at that point (see story, &ldquo;The Hunter and the
D&#259;kw&#259;&prime;&rdquo;). A fish called
<i>ug&ucirc;&ntilde;ste&prime;l&#301;</i>, &ldquo;having horns,&rdquo;
which appears only in spring, is believed to be transformed later into
the giga-tsuha&prime;l&#301; lizard, already mentioned. The fish is
described as having horns or projections upon its nose and beautiful
red spots upon its head, and as being attended or accompanied by many
smaller red fish, all of which, including the
ug&ucirc;&ntilde;ste&prime;l&#301;, are accustomed to pile up small
stones in the water. As the season <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308"
href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>advances it disappears and is
believed then to have turned into a giga-tsuha&prime;l&#301; lizard,
the change beginning at the head and finishing with the tail. It is
probably the <i>Campostoma</i> or stone roller, which is conspicuous
for its bright coloring in early spring, but loses its tints after
spawning. The meat of the sluggish hog-sucker is tabued to the ball
player, who must necessarily be active in movement. The fresh-water
mussel is called <i>d&#259;g&ucirc;&prime;n&#259;</i>, and the same
name is applied to certain pimples upon the face, on account of a
fancied resemblance. The ball player rubs himself with an eel skin to
make himself slippery and hard to hold, and, according to the
Wahnenauhi manuscript, women formerly tied up their hair with the dried
skin of an eel to make it grow long. A large red crawfish called
<i>tsiska&prime;g&#301;l&#301;</i>, much resembling a lobster, is used
to scratch young children in order to give them a strong grip, each
hand of the child being lightly scratched once with the pincer of the
living animal. A mother whose grown son had been thus treated when an
infant claimed that he could hold anything with his thumb and finger.
It is said, however, to render the child quarrelsome and disposed to
bite.</p>
<p>Of insects there is more to be said. The generic name for all sorts
of small insects and worms is <i>tsg&acirc;ya</i>, and according to the
doctors, who had anticipated the microbe theory by several centuries,
these tsg&acirc;ya are to blame for nearly every human ailment not
directly traceable to the <i>asgina</i> of the larger animals or to
witchcraft. The reason is plain. There are such myriads of them
everywhere on the earth and in the air that mankind is constantly
destroying them by wholesale, without mercy and almost without
knowledge, and this is their method of taking revenge.</p>
<p>Beetles are classed together under a name which signifies
&ldquo;insects with shells.&rdquo; The little water-beetle or
mellow-bug (<i lang="la">Dineutes discolor</i>) is called
<i>d&acirc;yuni&prime;s&#301;</i>, &ldquo;beaver&rsquo;s
grandmother,&rdquo; and according to the genesis tradition it brought
up the first earth from under the water. A certain green-headed beetle
with horns (<i>Phan&aelig;us carnifex</i>) is spoken of as the dog of
the Thunder boys, and the metallic-green luster upon its forehead is
said to have been caused by striking at the celebrated mythic gambler,
&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime;, &ldquo;Brass&rdquo; (see the story).
The June-bug (<i lang="la">Allorhina nitida</i>), another green beetle,
is <i>tag&ucirc;</i>, but is frequently called by the curious name of
<i>tu&prime;ya-d&#301;&prime;skalaw&#699;sti&prime;sk&#301;</i>,
&ldquo;one who keeps fire under the beans.&rdquo; Its larva is the
grubworm which presided at the meeting held by the insects to compass
the destruction of the human race (see the story, &ldquo;Origin of
Disease and Medicine&rdquo;). The large horned beetle (<i lang=
"la">Dynastes tityus</i>?) is called <i>tsist&ucirc;&prime;na</i>,
&ldquo;crawfish,&rdquo; <i>a&#699;w&#301;&prime;</i>,
&ldquo;deer,&rdquo; or <i>g&#259;l&#259;gi&prime;na</i>,
&ldquo;buck,&rdquo; on account of its branching horns. The snapping
beetle (<i lang="la">Alaus oculatus</i>?) is called
<i>t&ucirc;lsku&prime;wa</i>, &ldquo;one that snaps with his
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the <i>l&acirc;l&ucirc;</i> or jar-fly (<i lang="la">Cicada
auletes</i>) begins to sing in midsummer <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb309" href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>they say: &ldquo;The
jar-fly has brought the beans,&rdquo; his song being taken as the
signal that beans are ripe and that green corn is not far behind. When
the katydid (<i>ts&#301;k&#301;k&#301;&prime;</i>) is heard a little
later they say, &ldquo;Katydid has brought the roasting-ear
bread.&rdquo; The cricket (<i>t&#259;la&prime;t&#365;&prime;</i>) is
often called &ldquo;the barber&rdquo;
(<i>ditastaye&prime;sk&#301;</i>), on account of its habit of gnawing
hair from furs, and when the Cherokee meet a man with his hair clipped
unevenly they sometimes ask playfully, &ldquo;Did the cricket cut your
hair?&rdquo; (see story, &ldquo;Why the Possum&rsquo;s Tail is
Bare&rdquo;). Certain persons are said to drink tea made of crickets in
order to become good singers.</p>
<p>The mole cricket (<i lang="la">Gryllotalpa</i>), so called because
it tunnels in the earth and has hand-like claws fitted for digging, is
known to the Cherokee as <i>g&ucirc;l&#699;kw&acirc;g&#301;</i>, a word
which literally means &ldquo;seven,&rdquo; but is probably an
onomatope. It is reputed among them to be alert, hard to catch, and an
excellent singer, who &ldquo;never makes mistakes.&rdquo; Like the
crawfish and the cricket, it plays an important part in preparing
people for the duties of life. Infants slow in learning to speak have
their tongues scratched with the claw of a
g&ucirc;l&#699;kw&acirc;g&#301;, the living insect being held in the
hand during the operation, in order that they may soon learn to speak
distinctly and be eloquent, wise, and shrewd of speech as they grow
older, and of such quick intelligence as to remember without effort
anything once heard. The same desirable result may be accomplished with
a grown person, but with much more difficulty, as in that case it is
necessary to scratch the inside of the throat for four successive
mornings, the insect being pushed down with the fingers and again
withdrawn, while the regular tabus must be strictly observed for the
same period, or the operation will be without effect. In some cases the
insect is put into a small bowl of water overnight, and if still alive
in the morning it is taken out and the water given to the patient to
drink, after which the g&ucirc;l&#699;kw&acirc;g&#301; is set at
liberty.</p>
<p>Bees are kept by many of the Cherokee, in addition to the wild bees
which are hunted in the woods. Although they are said to have come
originally from the whites, the Cherokee have no tradition of a time
when they did not know them; there seems, however, to be no folklore
connected with them. The cow-ant (<i>Myrmica</i>?), a large, red,
stinging ant, is called properly
<i>das&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;t&#259;l&#301;
atats&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;sk&#301;</i>, &ldquo;stinging ant,&rdquo;
but, on account of its hard body-case, is frequently called
<i>n&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;yunu&prime;w&#301;</i>,
&ldquo;stone-dress,&rdquo; after a celebrated mythic monster. Strange
as it may seem, there appears to be no folklore connected with either
the firefly or the glowworm, while the spider, so prominent in other
tribal mythologies, appears in but a single Cherokee myth, where it
brings back the fire from across the water. In the formulas it is
frequently invoked to entangle in its threads the soul of a victim whom
the conjurer desires to bring under his evil spells. From a fancied
resemblance in appearance the name for spider,
<i>k&#259;&prime;n&#259;ne&prime;sk&#301;</i>, is applied also
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>to a watch or clock. A small yellowish moth
which flies about the fire at night is called
<i>t&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;t&#259;w&ucirc;</i>, a name implying that it
goes into and out of the fire, and when at last it flits too near and
falls into the blaze the Cherokee say,
&ldquo;T&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;t&#259;w&ucirc; is going to bed.&rdquo;
On account of its affinity for the fire it is invoked by the doctor in
all &ldquo;fire diseases,&rdquo; including sore eyes and frostbite.</p>

<h4 class="main">60. WHY THE BULLFROG&rsquo;S HEAD IS STRIPED</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">According to one version the Bullfrog was always
ridiculing the great gambler &Ucirc;&ntilde;tsai&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Brass,&rdquo; (see the story) until the latter at last got angry
and dared the Bullfrog to play the <i>gatay&ucirc;&prime;st&#301;</i>
(wheel-and-stick) game with him, whichever lost to be scratched on his
forehead. Brass won, as he always did, and the yellow stripes on the
Bullfrog&rsquo;s head show where the gambler&rsquo;s fingers scratched
him.</p>
<p>Another story is that the Bullfrog had a conjurer to paint his head
with yellow stripes (brass) to make him appear more handsome to a
pretty woman he was courting.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A young man courted a girl, who liked him well enough,
but her mother was so much opposed to him that she would not let him
come near the house. At last he made a trumpet from the handle of a
gourd and hid himself after night near the spring until the old woman
came down for water. While she was dipping up the water he put the
trumpet to his lips and grumbled out in a deep voice like a
bullfrog&rsquo;s:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Ya&ntilde;daska&prime;g&#259;

<p class="line">The faultfinder will die.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The woman thought it a witch bullfrog, and was so
frightened that she dropped her dipper and ran back to the house to
tell the people They all agreed that it was a warning to her to stop
interfering with her daughter&rsquo;s affairs, so she gave her consent,
and thus the young man won his wife.</p>
<p>There is another story of a girl who, every day when she went down
to the spring for water, heard a voice singing,
<i>K&ucirc;nu&prime;n&#365; t&ucirc;&prime;tsahyes&#301;&prime;,
K&ucirc;nu&prime;n&#365; t&ucirc;&prime;tsahyes&#301;&prime;</i>,
&ldquo;A bullfrog will marry you, A bullfrog will marry you.&rdquo; She
wondered much until one day when she came down she saw sitting on a
stone by the spring a bullfrog, which suddenly took the form of a young
man and asked her to marry him. She consented and took him back with
her to the house. But although he had the shape of a man there was a
queer bullfrog look about his face, so that the girl&rsquo;s family
hated him and at last persuaded her to send him away. She told him and
he went away, but when they next went <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>down to the spring
they heard a voice: <i>Ste&prime;ts&#301; t&ucirc;ya&prime;hus&#301;,
Ste&prime;ts&#301; t&ucirc;yahus&#301;&prime;</i>, &ldquo;Your daughter
will die, Your daughter will die,&rdquo; and so it happened soon
after.</p>
<p>As some tell it, the lover was a tadpole, who took on human shape,
retaining only his tadpole mouth. To conceal it he constantly refused
to eat with the family, but stood with his back to the fire and his
face screwed up, pretending that he had a toothache. At last his wife
grew suspicious and turning him suddenly around to the firelight,
exposed the tadpole mouth, at which they all ridiculed him so much that
he left the house forever.</p>

<h4 class="main">63. &Ucirc;&Ntilde;TSAIY&#300;&prime;, THE
GAMBLER</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thunder lives in the west, or a little to the south of
west, near the place where the sun goes down behind the water. In the
old times he sometimes made a journey to the east, and once after he
had come back from one of these journeys a child was born in the east
who, the people said, was his son. As the boy grew up it was found that
he had scrofula sores all over his body, so one day his mother said to
him, &ldquo;Your father, Thunder, is a great doctor. He lives far in
the west, but if you can find him he can cure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the boy set out to find his father and be cured. He traveled long
toward the west, asking of every one he met where Thunder lived, until
at last they began to tell him that it was only a little way ahead. He
went on and came to &Ucirc;&ntilde;tiguh&#301;&prime;, on Tennessee,
where lived &Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime; &ldquo;Brass.&rdquo; Now
&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime; was a great gambler, and made his
living that way. It was he who invented the <i>gatay&ucirc;st&#301;</i>
game that we play with a stone wheel and a stick. He lived on the south
side of the river, and everybody who came that way he challenged to
play against him. The large flat rock, with the lines and grooves where
they used to roll the wheel, is still there, with the wheels themselves
and the stick turned to stone. He won almost every time, because he was
so tricky, so that he had his house filled with all kinds of fine
things. Sometimes he would lose, and then he would bet all that he had,
even to his own life, but the winner got nothing for his trouble, for
&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime; knew how to take on different shapes,
so that he always got away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href=
"#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span></p>
<p>As soon as &Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime; saw him he asked him to
stop and play a while, but the boy said he was looking for his father,
Thunder, and had no time to wait. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime;, &ldquo;he lives in the next house;
you can hear him grumbling over there all the time&rdquo;&mdash;he
meant the Thunder&mdash;&ldquo;so we may as well have a game or two
before you go on.&rdquo; The boy said he had nothing to bet.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the gambler,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll play for your pretty spots.&rdquo; He said this to
make the boy angry so that he would play, but still the boy said he
must go first and find his father, and would come back afterwards.</p>
<p>He went on, and soon the news came to Thunder that a boy was looking
for him who claimed to be his son. Said Thunder, &ldquo;I have traveled
in many lands and have many children. Bring him here and we shall soon
know.&rdquo; So they brought in the boy, and Thunder showed him a seat
and told him to sit down. Under the blanket on the seat were long,
sharp thorns of the honey locust, with the points all sticking up, but
when the boy sat down they did not hurt him, and then Thunder knew that
it was his son. He asked the boy why he had come. &ldquo;I have sores
all over my body, and my mother told me you were my father and a great
doctor, and if I came here you would cure me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said his father, &ldquo;I am a great doctor, and I&rsquo;ll soon fix
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a large pot in the corner and he told his wife to fill it
with water and put it over the fire. When it was boiling, he put in
some roots, then took the boy and put him in with them. He let it boil
a long time until one would have thought that the flesh was boiled from
the poor boy&rsquo;s bones, and then told his wife to take the pot and
throw it into the river, boy and all. She did as she was told, and
threw it into the water, and ever since there is an eddy there that we
call &Ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;tiguh&#301;&prime;,
&ldquo;Pot-in-the-water.&rdquo; A service tree and a calico bush grew
on the bank above. A great cloud of steam came up and made streaks and
blotches on their bark, and it has been so to this day. When the steam
cleared away she looked over and saw the boy clinging to the roots of
the service tree where they hung down into the water, but now his skin
was all clean. She helped him up the bank, and they went back to the
house. On the way she told him, &ldquo;When we go in, your father will
put a new dress on you, but when he opens his box and tells you to pick
out your ornaments be sure to take them from the bottom. Then he will
send for his other sons to play ball against you. There is a
honey-locust tree in front of the house, and as soon as you begin to
get tired strike at that and your father will stop the play, because he
does not want to lose the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they went into the house, the old man was pleased to see the
boy looking so clean, and said, &ldquo;I knew I could soon cure those
spots. Now we must dress you.&rdquo; He brought out a fine suit of
buckskin, with belt and headdress, and had the boy put them on. Then he
opened a box and said, &ldquo;Now pick out your necklace and
bracelets.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313"
name="pb313">313</a>]</span>The boy looked, and the box was full of all
kinds of snakes gliding over each other with their heads up. He was not
afraid, but remembered what the woman had told him, and plunged his
hand to the bottom and drew out a great rattlesnake and put it around
his neck for a necklace. He put down his hand again four times and drew
up four copperheads and twisted them around his wrists and ankles. Then
his father gave him a war club and said, &ldquo;Now you must play a
ball game with your two elder brothers. They live beyond here in the
Darkening land, and I have sent for them.&rdquo; He said a ball game,
but he meant that the boy must fight for his life. The young men came,
and they were both older and stronger than the boy, but he was not
afraid and fought against them. The thunder rolled and the lightning
flashed at every stroke, for they were the young Thunders, and the boy
himself was Lightning. At last he was tired from defending himself
alone against two, and pretended to aim a blow at the honey-locust
tree. Then his father stopped the fight, because he was afraid the
lightning would split the tree, and he saw that the boy was brave and
strong.</p>
<p>The boy told his father how &Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime; had
dared him to play, and had even offered to play for the spots on his
skin. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Thunder, &ldquo;he is a great gambler and
makes his living that way, but I will see that you win.&rdquo; He
brought a small cymling gourd with a hole bored through the neck, and
tied it on the boy&rsquo;s wrist. Inside the gourd there was a string
of beads, and one end hung out from a hole in the top, but there was no
end to the string inside. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;go
back the way you came, and as soon as he sees you he will want to play
for the beads. He is very hard to beat, but this time he will lose
every game. When he cries out for a drink, you will know he is getting
discouraged, and then strike the rock with your war club and water will
come, so that you can play on without stopping. At last he will bet his
life, and lose. Then send at once for your brothers to kill him, or he
will get away, he is so tricky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy took the gourd and his war club and started east along the
road by which he had come. As soon as &Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime;
saw him he called to him, and when he saw the gourd with the bead
string hanging out he wanted to play for it. The boy drew out the
string, but there seemed to be no end to it, and he kept on pulling
until enough had come out to make a circle all around the playground.
&ldquo;I will play one game for this much against your stake,&rdquo;
said the boy, &ldquo;and when that is over we can have another
game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They began the game with the wheel and stick and the boy won.
&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime; did not know what to think of it, but
he put up another stake and called for a second game. The boy won
again, and so they played on until noon, when
&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime; had lost nearly everything he had and
was about discouraged. It was very hot, and he said, &ldquo;I am
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>thirsty,&rdquo; and wanted to stop long enough
to get a drink. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the boy, and struck the rock
with his club so that water came out, and they had a drink. They played
on until &Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime; had lost all his buckskins
and beaded work, his eagle feathers and ornaments, and at last offered
to bet his wife. They played and the boy won her. Then
&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime; was desperate and offered to stake
his life. &ldquo;If I win I kill you, but if you win you may kill
me.&rdquo; They played and the boy won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go and tell my wife,&rdquo; said
&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime;, &ldquo;so that she will receive her
new husband, and then you may kill me.&rdquo; He went into the house,
but it had two doors, and although the boy waited long
&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime; did not come back. When at last he
went to look for him he found that the gambler had gone out the back
way and was nearly out of sight going east.</p>
<p>The boy ran to his father&rsquo;s house and got his brothers to help
him. They brought their dog&mdash;the Horned Green Beetle&mdash;and
hurried after the gambler. He ran fast and was soon out of sight, and
they followed as fast as they could. After a while they met an old
woman making pottery and asked her if she had seen
&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime; and she said she had not. &ldquo;He
came this way,&rdquo; said the brothers. &ldquo;Then he must have
passed in the night,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;for I have been
here all day.&rdquo; They were about to take another road when the
Beetle, which had been circling about in the air above the old woman,
made a dart at her and struck her on the forehead, and it rang like
brass&mdash;<i>&ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime;</i>! Then they knew it
was Brass and sprang at him, but he jumped up in his right shape and
was off, running so fast that he was soon out of sight again. The
Beetle had struck so hard that some of the brass rubbed off, and we can
see it on the beetle&rsquo;s forehead yet.</p>
<p>They followed and came to an old man sitting by the trail, carving a
stone pipe. They asked him if he had seen Brass pass that way and he
said no, but again the Beetle&mdash;which could know Brass under any
shape&mdash;struck him on the forehead so that it rang like metal, and
the gambler jumped up in his right form and was off again before they
could hold him. He ran east until he came to the great water; then he
ran north until he came to the edge of the world, and had to turn again
to the west. He took every shape to throw them off the track, but the
Green Beetle always knew him, and the brothers pressed him so hard that
at last he could go no more and they caught him just as he reached the
edge of the great water where the sun goes down.</p>
<p>They tied his hands and feet with a grapevine and drove a long stake
through his breast, and planted it far out in the deep water. They set
two crows on the end of the pole to guard it and called the place
<i>K&acirc;g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</i>, &ldquo;Crow
place.&rdquo; But Brass never died, and can not die until the end of
the world, but lies there always with his face up. Sometimes he
struggles under the water to get free, and sometimes the beavers, who
are his friends, come and gnaw at the grapevine to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>release him. Then the pole shakes and the crows
at the top cry <i>Ka! Ka! Ka!</i> and scare the beavers away.</p>

<h4 class="main">64. THE NEST OF THE TL&#258;&prime;NUW&#258;</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the north bank of Little Tennessee river, in a bend
below the mouth of Citico creek, in Blount county, Tennessee, is a high
cliff hanging over the water, and about halfway up the face of the rock
is a cave with two openings. The rock projects outward above the cave,
so that the mouth can not be seen from above, and it seems impossible
to reach the cave either from above or below. There are white streaks
in the rock from the cave down to the water. The Cherokee call it
Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&acirc;&prime;&#301;, &ldquo;the place of the
Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;,&rdquo; or great mythic hawk.</p>
<p>In the old time, away back soon after the creation, a pair of
Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;s had their nest in this cave. The streaks in
the rock were made by the droppings from the nest. They were immense
birds, larger than any that live now, and very strong and savage. They
were forever flying up and down the river, and used to come into the
settlements and carry off dogs and even young children playing near the
houses. No one could reach the nest to kill them, and when the people
tried to shoot them the arrows only glanced off and were seized and
carried away in the talons of the Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;s.</p>
<p>At last the people went to a great medicine man, who promised to
help them. Some were afraid that if he failed to kill the
Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;s they would take revenge on the people, but
the medicine man said he could fix that. He made a long rope of linn
bark, just as the Cherokee still do, with loops in it for his feet, and
had the people let him down from the top of the cliff at a time when he
knew that the old birds were away. When he came opposite the mouth of
the cave he still could not reach it, because the rock above hung over,
so he swung himself backward and forward several times until the rope
swung near enough for him to pull himself into the cave with a hooked
stick that he carried, which he managed to fasten in some bushes
growing at the entrance. In the nest he found four young ones, and on
the floor of the cave were the bones of all sorts of animals that had
been carried there by the hawks. He pulled the young ones out of the
nest and threw them over the cliff into the deep water below, where a
great Uktena serpent that lived there finished them. Just then he saw
the two old ones coming, and had hardly time to climb up again to the
top of the rock before they reached the nest.</p>
<p>When they found the nest empty they were furious, and circled round
and round in the air until they saw the snake put up its head from the
water. Then they darted straight downward, and while one seized the
snake in his talons and flew far up in the sky with it, his mate struck
at it and bit off piece after piece until nothing was left. They were
so high up that when the pieces fell they made holes in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span>rock, which are still to be seen there, at the
place which we call &ldquo;Where the Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259; cut it
up,&rdquo; opposite the mouth of Citico. Then the two
Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;s circled up and up until they went out of
sight, and they have never been seen since.</p>

<h4 class="main">65. THE HUNTER AND THE TL&#258;&prime;NUW&#258;</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A hunter out in the woods one day saw a <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e9672" title=
"Source: Tl&#259;&prime;nuwa">Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;</span> overhead
and tried to hide from it, but the great bird had already seen him, and
sweeping down struck its claws into his hunting pack and carried him
far up into the air. As it flew, the Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;, which
was a mother bird, spoke and told the hunter that he need not be
afraid, as she would not hurt him, but only wanted him to stay for a
while with her young ones to guard them until they were old enough to
leave the nest. At last they alighted at the mouth of a cave in the
face of a steep cliff. Inside the water was dripping from the roof, and
at the farther end was a nest of sticks in which were two young birds.
The old Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259; set the hunter down and then flew
away, returning soon with a fresh-killed deer, which it tore in pieces,
giving the first piece to the hunter and then feeding the two young
hawks.</p>
<p>The hunter stayed in the cave many days until the young birds were
nearly grown, and every day the old mother hawk would fly away from the
nest and return in the evening with a deer or a bear, of which she
always gave the first piece to the hunter. He grew very anxious to see
his home again, but the Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259; kept telling him not
to be uneasy, but to wait a little while longer. At last he made up his
mind to escape from the cave and finally studied out a plan. The next
morning, after the old bird had gone, he dragged one of the young birds
to the mouth of the cave and tied himself to one of its legs with a
strap from his hunting pack. Then with the flat side of his tomahawk he
struck it several times in the head until it was dazed and helpless,
and pushed the bird and himself together off the shelf of rock into the
air.</p>
<p>They fell far, far down toward the earth, but the air from below
held up the bird&rsquo;s wings, so that it was almost as if they were
flying. As the Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259; revived it tried to fly upward
toward the nest, but the hunter struck it again with his hatchet until
it was dazed and dropped again. At last they came down in the top of a
poplar tree, when the hunter untied the strap from the leg of the young
bird and let it fly away, first pulling out a feather from its wing. He
climbed down from the tree and went to his home in the settlement, but
when he looked in his pack for the feather he found a stone
instead.</p>

<h4 class="main">66. U&#699;TL&Ucirc;&Ntilde;&prime;T&#258;, THE
SPEAR-FINGER</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long, long
ago&mdash;<i>h&#301;lahi&prime;yu</i>&mdash;there dwelt in the
mountains a terrible ogress, a woman monster, whose food was human
livers. She could take on any shape or appearance to suit her purpose,
but in her right <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317"
name="pb317">317</a>]</span>form she looked very much like an old
woman, excepting that her whole body was covered with a skin as hard as
a rock that no weapon could wound or penetrate, and that on her right
hand she had a long, stony forefinger of bone, like an awl or
spearhead, with which she stabbed everyone to whom she could get near
enough. On account of this fact she was called
<i>U&#699;tl&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;t&#259;</i>,
&ldquo;Spear-finger,&rdquo; and on account of her stony skin she was
sometimes called <i>N&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;yunu&prime;w&#301;</i>,
&ldquo;Stone-dress.&rdquo; There was another stone-clothed monster that
killed people, but that is a different story.</p>
<p>Spear-finger had such powers over stone that she could easily lift
and carry immense rocks, and could cement them together by merely
striking one against another. To get over the rough country more easily
she undertook to build a great rock bridge through the air from
N&ucirc;&ntilde;y&ucirc;&prime;-tlu&#699;g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;,
the &ldquo;Tree rock,&rdquo; on Hiwassee, over to
Sanigil&acirc;&prime;g&#301; (Whiteside mountain), on the Blue ridge,
and had it well started from the top of the &ldquo;Tree rock&rdquo;
when the lightning struck it and scattered the fragments along the
whole ridge, where the pieces can still be seen by those who go there.
She used to range all over the mountains about the heads of the streams
and in the dark passes of Nantahala, always hungry and looking for
victims. Her favorite haunt on the Tennessee side was about the gap on
the trail where Chilhowee mountain comes down to the river.</p>
<p>Sometimes an old woman would approach along the trail where the
children were picking strawberries or playing near the village, and
would say to them coaxingly, &ldquo;Come, my grandchildren, come to
your granny and let granny dress your hair.&rdquo; When some little
girl ran up and laid her head in the old woman&rsquo;s lap to be petted
and combed the old witch would gently run her fingers through the
child&rsquo;s hair until it went to sleep, when she would stab the
little one through the heart or back of the neck with the long awl
finger, which she had kept hidden under her robe. Then she would take
out the liver and eat it.</p>
<p>She would enter a house by taking the appearance of one of the
family who happened to have gone out for a short time, and would watch
her chance to stab some one with her long finger and take out his
liver. She could stab him without being noticed, and often the victim
did not even know it himself at the time&mdash;for it left no wound and
caused no pain&mdash;but went on about his own affairs, until all at
once he felt weak and began gradually to pine away, and was always sure
to die, because Spear-finger had taken his liver.</p>
<p>When the Cherokee went out in the fall, according to their custom,
to burn the leaves off from the mountains in order to get the chestnuts
on the ground, they were never safe, for the old witch was always on
the lookout, and as soon as she saw the smoke rise she knew there were
Indians there and sneaked up to try to surprise one alone. So as well
as they could they tried to keep together, and were very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>cautious of allowing any stranger to approach
the camp. But if one went down to the spring for a drink they never
knew but it might be the liver eater that came back and sat with
them.</p>
<p>Sometimes she took her proper form, and once or twice, when far out
from the settlements, a solitary hunter had seen an old woman, with a
queer-looking hand, going through the woods singing low to herself:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>Uwe&prime;la n&aacute;ts&#301;k&ucirc;&prime;.
Su&prime; s&#259;&prime; sai&prime;.</i></p>
<p class="line">Liver, I eat it. Su&prime; s&#259;&prime;
sai&prime;.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It was rather a pretty song, but it chilled his blood,
for he knew it was the liver eater, and he hurried away, silently,
before she might see him.</p>
<p>At last a great council was held to devise some means to get rid of
U&#700;tl&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;t&#259; before she should destroy
everybody. The people came from all around, and after much talk it was
decided that the best way would be to trap her in a pitfall where all
the warriors could attack her at once. So they dug a deep pitfall
across the trail and covered it over with earth and grass as if the
ground had never been disturbed. Then they kindled a large fire of
brush near the trail and hid themselves in the laurels, because they
knew she would come as soon as she saw the smoke.</p>
<p>Sure enough they soon saw an old woman coming along the trail. She
looked like an old woman whom they knew well in the village, and
although several of the wiser men wanted to shoot at her, the others
interfered, because they did not want to hurt one of their own people.
The old woman came slowly along the trail, with one hand under her
blanket, until she stepped upon the pitfall and tumbled through the
brush top into the deep hole below. Then, at once, she showed her true
nature, and instead of the feeble old woman there was the terrible
U&#700;tl&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;t&#259; with her stony skin, and her
sharp awl finger reaching out in every direction for some one to
stab.</p>
<p>The hunters rushed out from the thicket and surrounded the pit, but
shoot as true and as often as they could, their arrows struck the stony
mail of the witch only to be broken and fall useless at her feet, while
she taunted them and tried to climb out of the pit to get at them. They
kept out of her way, but were only wasting their arrows when a small
bird, <span class="corr" id="xd25e9722" title=
"Source: Utsu&prime;&#699;g&#301;">Uts&#365;&prime;&#699;g&#301;</span>,
the titmouse, perched on a tree overhead and began to sing
&ldquo;<i>un, un, un</i>.&rdquo; They thought it was saying
<i>u&prime;nah&#365;&prime;</i>, heart, meaning that they should aim at
the heart of the stone witch. They directed their arrows where the
heart should be, but the arrows only glanced off with the flint heads
broken.</p>
<p>Then they caught the Uts&#365;&prime;&#699;g&#301; and cut off its
tongue, so that ever since its tongue is short and everybody knows it
is a liar. When the hunters let it go it flew straight up into the sky
until it was out of sight and never came back again. The titmouse that
we know now is only an image of the other. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span></p>
<p>They kept up the fight without result until another bird, little
Ts&#301;&prime;k&#301;lil&#301;&prime;, the chickadee, flew down from a
tree and alighted upon the witch&rsquo;s right hand. The warriors took
this as a sign that they must aim there, and they were right, for her
heart was on the inside of her hand, which she kept doubled into a
fist, this same awl hand with which she had stabbed so many people. Now
she was frightened in earnest, and began to rush furiously at them with
her long awl finger and to jump about in the pit to dodge the arrows,
until at last a lucky arrow struck just where the awl joined her wrist
and she fell down dead.</p>
<p>Ever since the ts&#301;&prime;k&#301;lil&#301;&prime; is known as a
truth teller, and when a man is away on a journey, if this bird comes
and perches near the house and chirps its song, his friends know he
will soon be safe home.</p>

<h4 class="main">67. N&Ucirc;&Ntilde;&prime;YUNU&prime;W&#300;, THE
STONE MAN</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is what the old men told me when I was a boy.</p>
<p>Once when all the people of the settlement were out in the mountains
on a great hunt one man who had gone on ahead climbed to the top of a
high ridge and found a large river on the other side. While he was
looking across he saw an old man walking about on the opposite ridge,
with a cane that seemed to be made of some bright, shining rock. The
hunter watched and saw that every little while the old man would point
his cane in a certain direction, then draw it back and smell the end of
it. At last he pointed it in the direction of the hunting camp on the
other side of the mountain, and this time when he drew back the staff
he sniffed it several times as if it smelled very good, and then
started along the ridge straight for the camp. He moved very slowly,
with the help of the cane, until he reached the end of the ridge, when
he threw the cane out into the air and it became a bridge of shining
rock stretching across the river. After he had crossed over upon the
bridge it became a cane again, and the old man picked it up and started
over the mountain toward the camp.</p>
<p>The hunter was frightened, and felt sure that it meant mischief, so
he hurried on down the mountain and took the shortest trail back to the
camp to get there before the old man. When he got there and told his
story the medicine-man said the old man was a wicked cannibal monster
called N&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;yunu&prime;w&#301;, &ldquo;Dressed in
Stone,&rdquo; who lived in that part of the country, and was always
going about the mountains looking for some hunter to kill and eat. It
was very hard to escape from him, because his stick guided him like a
dog, and it was nearly as hard to kill him, because his whole body was
covered with a skin of solid rock. If he came he would kill and eat
them all, and there was only one way to save themselves. He could not
bear to look upon a menstrual woman, and if they could find seven
menstrual women to stand in the path as he came along the sight would
kill him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name=
"pb320">320</a>]</span></p>
<p>So they asked among all the women, and found seven who were sick in
that way, and with one of them it had just begun. By the order of the
medicine-man they stripped themselves and stood along the path where
the old man would come. Soon they heard
N&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;yunu&prime;w&#301; coming through the woods,
feeling his way with his stone cane. He came along the trail to where
the first woman was standing, and as soon as he saw her he started and
cried out: &ldquo;<i>Yu!</i> my grandchild; you are in a very bad
state!&rdquo; He hurried past her, but in a moment he met the next
woman, and cried out again: &ldquo;<i>Yu!</i> my child; you are in a
terrible way,&rdquo; and hurried past her, but now he was vomiting
blood. He hurried on and met the third and the fourth and the fifth
woman, but with each one that he saw his step grew weaker until when he
came to the last one, with whom the sickness had just begun, the blood
poured from his mouth and he fell down on the trail.</p>
<p>Then the medicine-man drove seven sourwood stakes through his body
and pinned him to the ground, and when night came they piled great logs
over him and set fire to them, and all the people gathered around to
see. N&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;yunu&prime;w&#301; was a great
ada&prime;weh&#301; and knew many secrets, and now as the fire came
close to him he began to talk, and told them the medicine for all kinds
of sickness. At midnight he began to sing, and sang the hunting songs
for calling up the bear and the deer and all the animals of the woods
and mountains. As the blaze grew hotter his voice sank low and lower,
until at last when daylight came, the logs were a heap of white ashes
and the voice was still.</p>
<p>Then the medicine-man told them to rake off the ashes, and where the
body had lain they found only a large lump of red
w&acirc;&prime;d&#301; paint and a magic
u&prime;l&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;ti stone. He kept the stone for
himself, and calling the people around him he painted them, on face and
breast, with the red w&acirc;&prime;d&#301;, and whatever each person
prayed for while the painting was being done&mdash;whether for hunting
success, for working skill, or for a long life&mdash;that gift was
his.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the old days there was a great fish called the
D&#259;kw&#259;&prime;, which lived in Tennessee river where Toco creek
comes in at D&#259;kw&acirc;&prime;&#301;, the
&ldquo;D&#259;kw&#259;&prime; place,&rdquo; above the mouth of Tellico,
and which was so large that it could easily swallow a man. Once a canoe
filled with warriors was crossing over from the town to the other side
of the river, when the D&#259;kw&#259;&prime; suddenly rose up under
the boat and threw them all into the air. As they came down it
swallowed one with a single snap of its jaws and dived with him to the
bottom of the river. As soon as the hunter came to his senses he found
that he had not been hurt, but it was so hot and close inside the
D&#259;kw&#259;&prime; that he was nearly smothered. As he groped
around in the dark his hand struck a lot of mussel shells <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>which the fish had swallowed, and taking one of
these for a knife he began to cut his way out, until soon the fish grew
uneasy at the scraping inside his stomach and came up to the top of the
water for air. He kept on cutting until the fish was in such pain that
it swam this way and that across the stream and thrashed the water into
foam with its tail. Finally the hole was so large that he could look
out and saw that the D&#259;kw&#259;&prime; was now resting in shallow
water near the shore. Reaching up he climbed out from the side of the
fish, moving very carefully so that the D&#259;kw&#259;&prime; would
not know it, and then waded to shore and got back to the settlement,
but the juices in the stomach of the great fish had scalded all the
hair from his head and he was bald ever after.</p>

wishing to go he ran away to the river. After playing in the sand for a
short time some boys of his acquaintance came by in a canoe and invited
him to join them. Glad of the opportunity to get away he went with
them, but had no sooner got in than the canoe began to tip and rock
most unaccountably. The boys became very much frightened, and in the
confusion the bad boy fell into the water and was immediately swallowed
by a large fish. After lying in its stomach for some time he became
very hungry, and on looking around he saw the fish&rsquo;s liver
hanging over his head. Thinking it dried meat, he tried to cut off a
piece with a mussel shell he had been playing with and still held in
his hand. The operation sickened the fish and it vomited the boy.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Westward from the headwaters of Oconaluftee river, in
the wildest depths of the Great Smoky mountains, which form the line
between North Carolina and Tennessee, is the enchanted lake of
Atag&acirc;&prime;h&#301;, &ldquo;Gall place.&rdquo; Although all the
Cherokee know that it is there, no one has ever seen it, for the way is
so difficult that only the animals know how to reach it. Should a stray
hunter come near the place he would know of it by the whirring sound of
the thousands of wild ducks flying about the lake, but on reaching the
spot he would find only a dry flat, without bird or animal or blade of
grass, unless he had first sharpened his spiritual vision by prayer and
fasting and an all-night vigil.</p>
<p>Because it is not seen, some people think the lake has dried up long
ago, but this is not true. To one who had kept watch and fast through
the night it would appear at daybreak as a wide-extending but shallow
sheet of purple water, fed by springs spouting from the high cliffs
around. In the water are all kinds of fish and reptiles, and swimming
upon the surface or flying overhead are great flocks of ducks and
pigeons, while all about the shores are bear tracks crossing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>in every direction. It is the medicine lake of
the birds and animals, and whenever a bear is wounded by the hunters he
makes his way through the woods to this lake and plunges into the
water, and when he comes out upon the other side his wounds are healed.
For this reason the animals keep the lake invisible to the hunter.</p>

<p class="first">The North went traveling, and after going far and
meeting many different tribes he finally fell in love with the daughter
of the South and wanted to marry her. The girl was willing, but her
parents objected and said, &ldquo;Ever since you came the weather has
been cold, and if you stay here we may all freeze to death.&rdquo; The
North pleaded hard, and said that if they would let him have their
daughter he would take her back to his own country, so at last they
consented. They were married and he took his bride to his own country,
and when she arrived there she found the people all living in ice
houses.</p>
<p>The next day, when the sun rose, the houses began to leak, and as it
climbed higher they began to melt, and it grew warmer and warmer, until
finally the people came to the young husband and told him he must send
his wife home again, or the weather would get so warm that the whole
settlement would be melted. He loved his wife and so held out as long
as he could, but as the sun grew hotter the people were more urgent,
and at last he had to send her home to her parents.</p>
<p>The people said that as she had been born in the South, and
nourished all her life upon food that grew in the same climate, her
whole nature was warm and unfit for the North.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once when the people were burning the woods in the
fall the blaze set fire to a poplar tree, which continued to burn until
the fire went down into the roots and burned a great hole in the
ground. It burned and burned, and the hole grew constantly larger,
until the people became frightened and were afraid it would burn the
whole world. They tried to put out the fire, but it had gone too deep,
and they did not know what to do.</p>
<p>At last some one said there was a man living in a house of ice far
in the north who could put out the fire, so messengers were sent, and
after traveling a long distance they came to the ice house and found
the Ice Man at home. He was a little fellow with long hair hanging down
to the ground in two plaits. The messengers told him their errand and
he at once said, &ldquo;O yes, I can help you,&rdquo; and began to
unplait his hair. When it was all unbraided he took it up in one hand
and struck it once across his other hand, and the messengers felt a
wind blow against <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323"
name="pb323">323</a>]</span>their cheeks. A second time he struck his
hair across his hand, and a light rain began to fall. The third time he
struck his hair across his open hand there was sleet mixed with the
raindrops, and when he struck the fourth time great hailstones fell
upon the ground, as if they had come out from the ends of his hair.
&ldquo;Go back now,&rdquo; said the Ice Man, &ldquo;and I shall be
there to-morrow.&rdquo; So the messengers returned to their people,
whom they found still gathered helplessly about the great burning
pit.</p>
<p>The next day while they were all watching about the fire there came
a wind from the north, and they were afraid, for they knew that it came
from the Ice Man. But the wind only made the fire blaze up higher. Then
a light rain began to fall, but the drops seemed only to make the fire
hotter. Then the shower turned to a heavy rain, with sleet and hail
that killed the blaze and made clouds of smoke and steam rise from the
red coals. The people fled to their homes for shelter, and the storm
rose to a whirlwind that drove the rain into every burning crevice and
piled great hailstones over the embers, until the fire was dead and
even the smoke ceased. When at last it was all over and the people
returned they found a lake where the burning pit had been, and from
below the water came a sound as of embers still crackling.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A hunter had been tramping over the mountains all day
long without finding any game and when the sun went down, he built a
fire in a hollow stump, swallowed a few mouthfuls of corn gruel and lay
down to sleep, tired out and completely discouraged. About the middle
of the night he dreamed and seemed to hear the sound of beautiful
singing, which continued until near daybreak and then appeared to die
away into the upper air.</p>
<p>All next day he hunted with the same poor success, and at night made
his lonely camp again in the woods. He slept and the strange dream came
to him again, but so vividly that it seemed to him like an actual
happening. Rousing himself before daylight, he still heard the song,
and feeling sure now that it was real, he went in the direction of the
sound and found that it came from a single green stalk of corn
(<i>selu</i>). The plant spoke to him, and told him to cut off some of
its roots and take them to his home in the settlement, and the next
morning to chew them and &ldquo;go to water&rdquo; before anyone else
was awake, and then to go out again into the woods, and he would kill
many deer and from that time on would always be successful in the hunt.
The corn plant continued to talk, teaching him hunting secrets and
telling him always to be generous with the game he took, until it was
noon and the sun was high, when it suddenly took the form of a woman
and rose gracefully into the air and was gone from sight, leaving the
hunter alone in the woods.</p>
<p>He returned home and told his story, and all the people knew that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A hunter was in the woods one day in winter when
suddenly he saw a panther coming toward him and at once prepared to
defend himself. The panther continued to approach, and the hunter was
just about to shoot when the animal spoke, and at once it seemed to the
man as if there was no difference between them, and they were both of
the same nature. The panther asked him where he was going, and the man
said that he was looking for a deer. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the
panther, &ldquo;we are getting ready for a Green-corn dance, and there
are seven of us out after a buck, so we may as well hunt
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hunter agreed and they went on together. They started up one
deer and another, but the panther made no sign, and said
only<span class="corr" id="xd25e9823" title="Not in source">,</span>
&ldquo;Those are too small; we want something better.&rdquo; So the
hunter did not shoot, and they went on. They started up another deer, a
larger one, and the panther sprang upon it and tore its throat, and
finally killed it after a hard struggle. The hunter got out his knife
to skin it, but the panther said the skin was too much torn to be used
and they must try again. They started up another large deer, and this
the panther killed without trouble, and then, wrapping his tail around
it, threw it across his back. &ldquo;Now, come to our townhouse,&rdquo;
he said to the hunter.</p>
<p>The panther led the way, carrying the captured deer upon his back,
up a little stream branch until they came to the head spring, when it
seemed as if a door opened in the side of the hill and they went in.
Now the hunter found himself in front of a large townhouse, with the
finest dets&#259;n&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;l&#301; he had ever seen, and
the trees around were green, and the air was warm, as in summer. There
was a great company there getting ready for the dance, and they were
all panthers, but somehow it all seemed natural to the hunter. After a
while the others who had been out came in with the deer they had taken,
and the dance began. The hunter danced several rounds, and then said it
was growing late and he must be getting home. So the panthers opened
the door and he went out, and at once found himself alone in the woods
again, and it was winter and very cold, with snow on the ground and on
all the trees. When he reached the settlement he found a party just
starting out to search for him. They asked him where he had been so
long, and he told them the story, and then he found that he had been in
the panther townhouse several days instead of only a very short time,
as he had thought.</p>
<p>He died within seven days after his return, because he had already
begun to take on the panther nature, and so could not live again with
men. If he had stayed with the panthers he would have lived.

<p class="first">Once some young men of the Cherokee set out to see
what was in the world and traveled south until they came to a tribe of
little people called <i>Tsundige&prime;w&#301;</i>, with very queer
shaped bodies, hardly tall enough to reach up to a man&rsquo;s knee,
who had no houses, but lived in nests scooped in the sand and covered
over with dried grass. The little fellows were so weak and puny that
they could not fight at all, and were in constant terror from the wild
geese and other birds that used to come in great flocks from the south
to make war upon them.</p>
<p>Just at the time that the travelers got there they found the little
men in great fear, because there was a strong wind blowing from the
south and it blew white feathers and down along the sand, so that the
Tsundige&prime;w&#301; knew their enemies were coming not far behind.
The Cherokee asked them why they did not defend themselves, but they
said they could not, because they did not know how. There was no time
to make bows and arrows, but the travelers told them to take sticks for
clubs, and showed them where to strike the birds on the necks to kill
them.</p>
<p>The wind blew for several days, and at last the birds came, so many
that they were like a great cloud in the air, and alighted on the
sands. The little men ran to their nests, and the birds followed and
stuck in their long bills to pull them out and eat them. This time,
though, the Tsundige&prime;w&#301; had their clubs, and they struck the
birds on the neck, as the Cherokee had shown them, and killed so many
that at last the others were glad to spread their wings and fly away
again to the south.</p>
<p>The little men thanked the Cherokee for their help and gave them the
best they had until the travelers went on to see the other tribes. They
heard afterwards that the birds came again several times, but that the
Tsundige&prime;w&#301; always drove them off with their clubs, until a
flock of sandhill cranes came. They were so tall that the little men
could not reach up to strike them on the neck, and so at last the
cranes killed them all.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago there was a Cherokee clan called the
Ani&prime;-Ts&acirc;&prime;g&ucirc;h&#301;, and in one family of this
clan was a boy who used to leave home and be gone all day in the
mountains. After a while he went oftener and stayed longer, until at
last he would not eat in the house at all, but started off at daybreak
and did not come back until night. His parents scolded, but that did no
good, and the boy still went every day until they noticed that long
brown hair was beginning to grow out all over his body. Then they
wondered and asked him why it was that he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb326" href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>wanted to be so much
in the woods that he would not even eat at home. Said the boy, &ldquo;I
find plenty to eat there, and it is better than the corn and beans we
have in the settlements, and pretty soon I am going into the woods to
stay all the time.&rdquo; His parents were worried and begged him not
to leave them, but he said, &ldquo;It is better there than here, and
you see I am beginning to be different already, so that I can not live
here any longer. If you will come with me, there is plenty for all of
us and you will never have to work for it; but if you want to come you
must first fast seven days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father and mother talked it over and then told the headmen of
the clan. They held a council about the matter and after everything had
been said they decided: &ldquo;Here we must work hard and have not
always enough. There he says there is always plenty without work. We
will go with him.&rdquo; So they fasted seven days, and on the seventh
morning all the Ani&prime;-Ts&acirc;&prime;g&ucirc;h&#301; left the
settlement and started for the mountains as the boy led the way.</p>
<p>When the people of the other towns heard of it they were very sorry
and sent their headmen to persuade the
Ani&prime;-Ts&acirc;&prime;g&ucirc;h&#301; to stay at home and not go
into the woods to live. The messengers found them already on the way,
and were surprised to notice that their bodies were beginning to be
covered with hair like that of animals, because for seven days they had
not taken human food and their nature was changing. The
Ani&prime;-Ts&acirc;&prime;g&ucirc;h&#301; would not come back, but
said, &ldquo;We are going where there is always plenty to eat.
Hereafter we shall be called <i>y&acirc;n&ucirc;</i> (bears), and when
you yourselves are hungry come into the woods and call us and we shall
come to give you our own flesh. You need not be afraid to kill us, for
we shall live always.&rdquo; Then they taught the messengers the songs
with which to call them, and the bear hunters have these songs still.
When they had finished the songs the
Ani&prime;-Ts&acirc;&prime;g&ucirc;h&#301; started on again and the
messengers turned back to the settlements, but after going a little way
they looked back and saw a drove of bears going into the woods.</p>

<h4 class="main">76. THE BEAR MAN</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A man went hunting in the mountains and came across a
black bear, which he wounded with an arrow. The bear turned and started
to run the other way, and the hunter followed, shooting one arrow after
another into it without bringing it down. Now, this was a medicine
bear, and could talk or read the thoughts of people without their
saying a word. At last he stopped and pulled the arrows out of his side
and gave them to the man, saying, &ldquo;It is of no use for you to
shoot at me, for you can not kill me. Come to my house and let us live
together.&rdquo; The hunter thought to himself, &ldquo;He may kill
me;&rdquo; but the bear read his thoughts and said, &ldquo;No, I
won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo; The man thought again, &ldquo;How can I
get anything to eat?&rdquo; but the bear knew his thoughts, and said,
&ldquo;There shall be plenty.&rdquo; So the hunter went with the
bear.</p>
<p>They went on together until they came to a hole in the side of the
mountain, and the bear said, &ldquo;This is not where I live, but there
is going to be a council here and we will see what they do.&rdquo; They
went in, and the hole widened as they went, until they came to a large
cave like a townhouse. It was full of bears&mdash;old bears, young
bears, and cubs, white bears, black bears, and brown bears&mdash;and a
large white bear was the chief. They sat down in a corner, but soon the
bears scented the hunter and began to ask, &ldquo;What is it that
smells <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>bad?&rdquo; The chief said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
talk so; it is only a stranger come to see us. Let him alone.&rdquo;
Food was getting scarce in the mountains, and the council was to decide
what to do about it. They had sent out messengers all over, and while
they were talking two bears came in and reported that they had found a
country in the low grounds where there were so many chestnuts and
acorns that mast was knee deep. Then they were all pleased, and got
ready for a dance, and the dance leader was the one the Indians call
Kal&acirc;s&prime;-g&ucirc;n&#259;hi&prime;ta, &ldquo;Long Hams,&rdquo;
a great black bear that is always lean. After the dance the bears
noticed the hunter&rsquo;s bow and arrows, and one said, &ldquo;This is
what men use to kill us. Let us see if we can manage them, and may be
we can fight man with his own weapons.&rdquo; So they took the bow and
arrows from the hunter to try them. They fitted the arrow and drew back
the string, but when they let go it caught in their long claws and the
arrows dropped to the ground. They saw that they could not use the bow
and arrows and gave them back to the man. When the dance and the
council were over, they began to go home, excepting the White Bear
chief, who lived there, and at last the hunter and the bear went out
together.</p>
<p>They went on until they came to another hole in the side of the
mountain, when the bear said, &ldquo;This is where I live,&rdquo; and
they went in. By this time the hunter was very hungry and was wondering
how he could get something to eat. The other knew his thoughts, and
sitting up on his hind legs he rubbed his stomach with his
forepaws&mdash;<i>so</i>&mdash;and at once he had both paws full of
chestnuts and gave them to the man. He rubbed his stomach
again&mdash;<i>so</i>&mdash;and had his paws full of huckleberries, and
gave them to the man. He rubbed again&mdash;<i>so</i>&mdash;and gave
the man both paws full of blackberries. He rubbed
again&mdash;<i>so</i>&mdash;and had his paws full of acorns, but the
man said that he could not eat them, and that he had enough
already.</p>
<p>The hunter lived in the cave with the bear all winter, until long
hair like that of a bear began to grow all over his body and he began
to act like a bear; but he still walked like a man. One day in early
spring the bear said to him, &ldquo;Your people down in the settlement
are getting ready for a grand hunt in these mountains, and they will
come to this cave and kill me and take these clothes from
me&rdquo;&mdash;he meant his skin&mdash;&ldquo;but they will not hurt
you and will take you home with them.&rdquo; The bear knew what the
people were doing down in the settlement just as he always knew what
the man was thinking about. Some days passed and the bear said again,
&ldquo;This is the day when the Topknots will come to kill me, but the
Split-noses will come first and find us. When they have killed me they
will drag me outside the cave and take off my clothes and cut me in
pieces. You must cover the blood with leaves, and when they are taking
you away look back after you have gone a piece and you will see
something.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329"
name="pb329">329</a>]</span></p>
<p>Soon they heard the hunters coming up the mountain, and then the
dogs found the cave and began to bark. The hunters came and looked
inside and saw the bear and killed him with their arrows. Then they
dragged him outside the cave and skinned the body and cut it in
quarters to carry home. The dogs kept on barking until the hunters
thought there must be another bear in the cave. They looked in again
and saw the man away at the farther end. At first they thought it was
another bear on account of his long hair, but they soon saw it was the
hunter who had been lost the year before, so they went in and brought
him out. Then each hunter took a load of the bear meat and they started
home again, bringing the man and the skin with them. Before they left
the man piled leaves over the spot where they had cut up the bear, and
when they had gone a little way he looked behind and saw the bear rise
up out of the leaves, shake himself, and go back into the woods.</p>
<p>When they came near the settlement the man told the hunters that he
must be shut up where no one could see him, without anything to eat or
drink for seven days and nights, until the bear nature had left him and
he became like a man again. So they shut him up alone in a house and
tried to keep very still about it, but the news got out and his wife
heard of it. She came for her husband, but the people would not let her
near him; but she came every day and begged so hard that at last after
four or five days they let her have him. She took him home with her,
but in a short time he died, because he still had a bear&rsquo;s nature
and could not live like a man. If they had kept him shut up and fasting
until the end of the seven days he would have become a man again and
would have lived.</p>

<h4 class="main">77. THE GREAT LEECH OF TLANUSI&prime;Y&#300;</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The spot where Valley river joins Hiwassee, at Murphy,
in North Carolina, is known among the Cherokees as
Tlanusi&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;The Leech place,&rdquo; and this is the
story they tell of it:</p>
<p>Just above the junction is a deep hole in Valley river, and above it
is a ledge of rock running across the stream, over which people used to
go as on a bridge. On the south side the trail ascended a high bank,
from which they could look down into the water. One day some men going
along the trail saw a great red object, full as large as a house, lying
on the rock ledge in the middle of the stream below them. As they stood
wondering what it could be they saw it unroll&mdash;and then they knew
it was alive&mdash;and stretch itself out along the rock until it
looked like a great leech with red and white stripes along its body. It
rolled up into a ball and again stretched out at full length, and at
last crawled down the rock and was out of sight in the deep water. The
water began to boil and foam, and a great column of white spray was
thrown high in the air and came down like a waterspout upon the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>very spot where the men had been standing, and
would have swept them all into the water but that they saw it in time
and ran from the place.</p>
<p>More than one person was carried down in this way, and their friends
would find the body afterwards lying upon the bank with the ears and
nose eaten off, until at last the people were afraid to go across the
ledge any more, on account of the great leech, or even to go along that
part of the trail. But there was one young fellow who laughed at the
whole story, and said that he was not afraid of anything in Valley
river, as he would show them. So one day he painted his face and put on
his finest buckskin and started off toward the river, while all the
people followed at a distance to see what might happen. Down the trail
he went and out upon the ledge of rock, singing in high spirits:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>Tlanu&prime;s&#301; g&#259;ne&prime;ga
digi&prime;g&#259;ge</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Dakwa&prime;nitlaste&prime;st&#301;.</i></p>
<p class="line">I&rsquo;ll tie red leech skins</p>
<p class="line">On my legs for garters.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But before he was half way across the water began to
boil into white foam and a great wave rose and swept over the rock and
carried him down, and he was never seen again.</p>
<p>Just before the Removal, sixty years ago, two women went out upon
the ledge to fish. Their friends warned them of the danger, but one
woman who had her baby on her back said, &ldquo;There are fish there
and I&rsquo;m going to have some; I&rsquo;m tired of this fat
meat.&rdquo; She laid the child down on the rock and was preparing the
line when the water suddenly rose and swept over the ledge, and would
have carried off the child but that the mother ran in time to save it.
The great leech is still there in the deep hole, because when people
look down they see something alive moving about on the bottom, and
although they can not distinguish its shape on account of the ripples
on the water, yet they know it is the leech. Some say there is an
underground waterway across to Nottely river, not far above the mouth,
where the river bends over toward Murphy, and sometimes the leech goes
over there and makes the water boil as it used to at the rock ledge.
They call this spot on Nottely &ldquo;The Leech place&rdquo; also.</p>

<h4 class="main">78. THE N&Ucirc;&Ntilde;N&#276;&prime;H&#300; AND
OTHER SPIRIT FOLK</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;</i> or
immortals, the &ldquo;people who live anywhere,&rdquo; were a race of
spirit people who lived in the highlands of the old Cherokee country
and had a great many townhouses, especially in the bald mountains, the
high peaks on which no timber ever grows. They had large townhouses in
Pilot knob and under the old N&#301;kw&#259;s&#301;&prime; mound in
North Carolina, and another under Blood mountain, at the head of
Nottely river, in Georgia. They were invisible excepting when they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>wanted to be seen, and then they looked and
spoke just like other Indians. They were very fond of music and
dancing, and hunters in the mountains would often hear the dance songs
and the drum beating in some invisible townhouse, but when they went
toward the sound it would shift about and they would hear it behind
them or away in some other direction, so that they could never find the
place where the dance was. They were a friendly people, too, and often
brought lost wanderers to their townhouses under the mountains and
cared for them there until they were rested and then guided them back
to their homes. More than once, also, when the Cherokee were hard
pressed by the enemy, the N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;
warriors have come out, as they did at old
N&#301;kw&#259;s&#301;&prime;, and have saved them from defeat. Some
people have thought that they are the same as the
Y&ucirc;&ntilde;w&#301; Tsunsdi&prime;, the &ldquo;Little
People&rdquo;; but these are fairies, no larger in size than
children.</p>
<p>There was a man in Nottely town who had been with the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; when he was a boy, and he told
Wafford all about it. He was a truthful, hard-headed man, and Wafford
had heard the story so often from other people that he asked this man
to tell it. It was in this way:</p>
<p>When he was about 10 or 12 years old he was playing one day near the
river, shooting at a mark with his bow and arrows, until he became
tired, and started to build a fish trap in the water. While he was
piling up the stones in two long walls a man came and stood on the bank
and asked him what he was doing. The boy told him, and the man said,
&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s pretty hard work and you ought to rest a
while. Come and take a walk up the river.&rdquo; The boy said,
&ldquo;No&rdquo;; that he was going home to dinner soon. &ldquo;Come
right up to my house,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
give you a good dinner there and bring you home again in the
morning.&rdquo; So the boy went with him up the river until they came
to a house, when they went in, and the man&rsquo;s wife and the other
people there were very glad to see him, and gave him a fine dinner, and
were very kind to him. While they were eating a man that the boy knew
very well came in and spoke to him, so that he felt quite at home.</p>
<p>After dinner he played with the other children and slept there that
night, and in the morning, after breakfast, the man got ready to take
him home. They went down a path that had a cornfield on one side and a
peach orchard fenced in on the other, until they came to another trail,
and the man said, &ldquo;Go along this trail across that ridge and you
will come to the river road that will bring you straight to your home,
and now I&rsquo;ll go back to the house.&rdquo; So the man went back to
the house and the boy went on along the trail, but when he had gone a
little way he looked back, and there was no cornfield or orchard or
fence or house; nothing but trees on the mountain side.</p>
<p>He thought it very queer, but somehow he was not frightened, and
went on until he came to the river trail in sight of his home. There
were a great many people standing about talking, and when they saw
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>him they ran toward him shouting, &ldquo;Here he
is! He is not drowned or killed in the mountains!&rdquo; They told him
they had been hunting him ever since yesterday noon, and asked him
where he had been. &ldquo;A man took me over to his house just across
the ridge, and I had a fine dinner and a good time with the
children,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;I thought Udsi&prime;skal&#259;
here&rdquo;&mdash;that was the name of the man he had seen at
dinner&mdash;&ldquo;would tell you where I was.&rdquo; But
Udsi&prime;skal&#259; said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you. I was out
all day in my canoe hunting you. It was one of the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; that made himself look like
me.&rdquo; Then his mother said, &ldquo;You say you had dinner
there?<span class="corr" id="xd25e10019" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> &ldquo;Yes, and I had plenty,
too,&rdquo; said the boy; but his mother answered, &ldquo;There is no
house there&mdash;only trees and rocks&mdash;but we hear a drum
sometimes in the big bald above. The people you saw were the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once four N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; women came to a
dance at Nottely town, and danced half the night with the young men
there, and nobody knew that they were
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;, but thought them visitors from
another settlement. About midnight they left to go home, and some men
who had come out from the townhouse to cool off watched to see which
way they went. They saw the women go down the trail to the river ford,
but just as they came to the water they disappeared, although it was a
plain trail, with no place where they could hide. Then the watchers
knew they were N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; women. Several men
saw this happen, and one of them was Wafford&rsquo;s father-in-law, who
was known for an honest man. At another time a man named Burnt-tobacco
was crossing over the ridge from Nottely to Hemptown in Georgia and
heard a drum and the songs of dancers in the hills on one side of the
trail. He rode over to see who could be dancing in such a place, but
when he reached the spot the drum and the songs were behind him, and he
was so frightened that he hurried back to the trail and rode all the
way to Hemptown as hard as he could to tell the story. He was a
truthful man, and they believed what he said.</p>
<p>There must have been a good many of the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; living in that neighborhood,
because the drumming was often heard in the high balds almost up to the
time of the Removal.</p>
<p>On a small upper branch of Nottely, running nearly due north from
Blood mountain, there was also a hole, like a small well or chimney,
<span class="corr" id="xd25e10028" title="Source: in in">in</span> the
ground, from which there came up a warm vapor that heated all the air
around. People said that this was because the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; had a townhouse and a fire under
the mountain. Sometimes in cold weather hunters would stop there to
warm themselves, but they were afraid to stay long. This was more than
sixty years ago, but the hole is probably there yet.</p>
<p>Close to the old trading path from South Carolina up to the Cherokee
Nation, somewhere near the head of Tugaloo, there was formerly a noted
circular depression about the size of a townhouse, and waist
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>deep. Inside it was always clean as though swept
by unknown hands. Passing traders would throw logs and rocks into it,
but would always, on their return, find them thrown far out from the
hole. The Indians said it was a N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;
townhouse, and never liked to go near the place or even to talk about
it, until at last some logs thrown in by the traders were allowed to
remain there, and then they concluded that the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;, annoyed by the persecution of
the white men, had abandoned their townhouse forever.</p>
<p>There is another race of spirits, the <i>Y&ucirc;&ntilde;w&#301;
Tsunsdi&prime;</i>, or &ldquo;Little People,&rdquo; who live in rock
caves on the mountain side. They are little fellows, hardly reaching up
to a man&rsquo;s knee, but well shaped and handsome, with long hair
falling almost to the ground. They are great wonder workers and are
very fond of music, spending half their time drumming and dancing. They
are helpful and kind-hearted, and often when people have been lost in
the mountains, especially children who have strayed away from their
parents, the Y&ucirc;&ntilde;w&#301; Tsunsdi&prime; have found them and
taken care of them and brought them back to their homes. Sometimes
their drum is heard in lonely places in the mountains, but it is not
safe to follow it, because the Little People do not like to be
disturbed at home, and they throw a spell over the stranger so that he
is bewildered and loses his way, and even if he does at last get back
to the settlement he is like one dazed ever after. Sometimes, also,
they come near a house at night and the people inside hear them
talking, but they must not go out, and in the morning they find the
corn gathered or the field cleared as if a whole force of men had been
at work. If anyone should go out to watch, he would die. When a hunter
finds anything in the woods, such as a knife or a trinket, he must say,
&ldquo;Little People, I want to take this,&rdquo; because it may belong
to them, and if he does not ask their permission they will throw stones
at him as he goes home.</p>
<p>Once a hunter in winter found tracks in the snow like the tracks of
little children. He wondered how they could have come there and
followed them until they led him to a cave, which was full of Little
People, young and old, men, women, and children. They brought him in
and were kind to him, and he was with them some time; but when he left
they warned him that he must not tell or he would die. He went back to
the settlement and his friends were all anxious to know where he had
been. For a long time he refused to say, until at last he could not
hold out any longer, but told the story, and in a few days he died.
Only a few years ago two hunters from Raventown, going behind the high
fall near the head of Oconaluftee on the East Cherokee reservation,
found there a cave with fresh footprints of the Little People all over
the floor.</p>
<p>During the smallpox among the East Cherokee just after the war one
sick man wandered off, and his friends searched, but could not find
him. After several weeks he came back and said that the Little
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>People had found him and taken him to one of
their caves and tended him until he was cured.</p>
<p>About twenty-five years ago a man named Tsant&#259;w&ucirc;&prime;
was lost in the mountains on the head of Oconaluftee. It was winter
time and very cold and his friends thought he must be dead, but after
sixteen days he came back and said that the Little People had found him
and taken him to their cave, where he had been well treated, and given
plenty of everything to eat except bread. This was in large loaves, but
when he took them in his hand to eat they seemed to shrink into small
cakes so light and crumbly that though he might eat all day he would
not be satisfied. After he was well rested they had brought him a part
of the way home until they came to a small creek, about knee deep, when
they told him to wade across to reach the main trail on the other side.
He waded across and turned to look back, but the Little People were
gone and the creek was a deep river. When he reached home his legs were
frozen to the knees and he lived only a few days.</p>
<p>Once the Y&ucirc;&ntilde;w&#301; Tsunsdi&prime; had been very kind
to the people of a certain settlement, helping them at night with their
work and taking good care of any lost children, until something
happened to offend them and they made up their minds to leave the
neighborhood. Those who were watching at the time saw the whole company
of Little People come down to the ford of the river and cross over and
disappear into the mouth of a large cave on the other side. They were
never heard of near the settlement again.</p>
<p>There are other fairies, the <i>Y&ucirc;&ntilde;w&#301;
Amai&prime;y&#301;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;</i>, or Water-dwellers, who
live in the water, and fishermen pray to them for help. Other friendly
spirits live in people&rsquo;s houses, although no one can see them,
and so long as they are there to protect the house no witch can come
near to do mischief.</p>
<p><i>Ts&#259;wa&prime;s&#301;</i> and <i>Ts&#259;ga&prime;s&#301;</i>
are the names of two small fairies, who are mischievous enough, but yet
often help the hunter who prays to them. Ts&#259;wa&prime;s&#301;, or
Ts&#259;wa&prime;s&#301; Usdi&prime;ga (Little
Ts&#259;wa&prime;s&#301;), is a tiny fellow, very handsome, with long
hair falling down to his feet, who lives in grassy patches on the
hillsides and has great power over the game. To the deer hunter who
prays to him he gives skill to slip up on the deer through the long
grass without being seen. Ts&#259;ga&prime;s&#301; is another of the
spirits invoked by the hunter and is very helpful, but when someone
trips and falls, we know that it is Ts&#259;ga&prime;s&#301; who has
caused it. There are several other of these fairies with names, all
good-natured, but more or less tricky.</p>
<p>Then there is <i>De&prime;ts&#259;t&#259;</i>.
De&prime;ts&#259;t&#259; was once a boy who ran away to the woods to
avoid a scratching and tries to keep himself invisible ever since. He
is a handsome little fellow and spends his whole time hunting birds
with blowgun and arrow. He has a great many children who are all just
like him and have the same name. When a flock of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>birds flies up suddenly as if frightened it is
because De&prime;ts&#259;t&#259; is chasing them. He is mischievous and
sometimes hides an arrow from the bird hunter, who may have shot it off
into a perfectly clear space, but looks and looks without finding it.
Then the hunter says, &ldquo;De&prime;ts&#259;t&#259;, you have my
arrow, and if you don&rsquo;t give it up I&rsquo;ll scratch you,&rdquo;
and when he looks again he finds it.</p>
<p>There is one spirit that goes about at night with a light. The
Cherokee call it <i>Atsil&prime;-dihye&prime;g&#301;</i>, &ldquo;The
Fire-carrier,&rdquo; and they are all afraid of it, because they think
it dangerous, although they do not know much about it. They do not even
know exactly what it looks like, because they are afraid to stop when
they see it. It may be a witch instead of a spirit. Wafford&rsquo;s
mother saw the &ldquo;Fire-carrier&rdquo; once when she was a young
woman, as she was coming home at night from a trading post in South
Carolina. It seemed to be following her from behind, and she was
frightened and whipped up her horse until she got away from it and
never saw it again.</p>

<h4 class="main">79. THE REMOVED TOWNHOUSES</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago, long before the Cherokee were driven from
their homes in 1838, the people on Valley river and Hiwassee heard
voices of invisible spirits in the air calling and warning them of wars
and misfortunes which the future held in store, and inviting them to
come and live with the N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;, the
Immortals, in their homes under the mountains and under the waters. For
days the voices hung in the air, and the people listened until they
heard the spirits say, &ldquo;If you would live with us, gather
everyone in your townhouses and fast there for seven days, and no one
must raise a shout or a warwhoop in all that time. Do this and we shall
come and you will see us and we shall take you to live with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people were afraid of the evils that were to come, and they knew
that the Immortals of the mountains and the waters were happy forever,
so they counciled in their townhouses and decided to go with them.
Those of Anisgay&acirc;&prime;y&#301; town came all together into their
townhouse and prayed and fasted for six days. On the seventh day there
was a sound from the distant mountains, and it came nearer and grew
louder until a roar of thunder was all about the townhouse and they
felt the ground shake under them. Now they were frightened, and despite
the warning some of them screamed out. The
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;, who had already lifted up the
townhouse with its mound to carry it away, were startled by the cry and
let a part of it fall to the earth, where now we see the mound of
S&#277;&prime;ts&#301;. They steadied themselves again and bore the
rest of the townhouse, with all the people in it, to the top of
Tsuda&prime;ye&#699;l&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301; (Lone peak), near
the head of Cheowa, where we can still see it, changed long ago to
solid rock, but the people are invisible and immortal. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span></p>
<p>The people of another town, on Hiwassee, at the place which we call
now Du&prime;stiya&#699;l&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, where Shooting
creek comes in, also prayed and fasted, and at the end of seven days
the N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; came and took them away down
under the water. They are there now, and on a warm summer day, when the
wind ripples the surface, those who listen well can hear them talking
below. When the Cherokee drag the river for fish the fish-drag always
stops and catches there, although the water is deep, and the people
know it is being held by their lost kinsmen, who do not want to be
forgotten.</p>
<p>When the Cherokee were forcibly removed to the West one of the
greatest regrets of those along Hiwassee and Valley rivers was that
they were compelled to leave behind forever their relatives who had
gone to the N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;.</p>
<p>In Tennessee river, near Kingston, 18 miles below Loudon, Tennessee,
is a place which the Cherokee call Gust&#301;&prime;, where there once
was a settlement long ago, but one night while the people were gathered
in the townhouse for a dance the bank caved in and carried them all
down into the river. Boatmen passing the spot in their canoes see the
round dome of the townhouse&mdash;now turned to stone&mdash;in the
water below them and sometimes hear the sound of the drum and dance
coming up, and they never fail to throw food into the water in return
for being allowed to cross in safety.</p>

<h4 class="main">80. THE SPIRIT DEFENDERS OF
N&#300;KW&#258;S&#300;&prime;</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago a powerful unknown tribe invaded the country
from the southeast, killing people and destroying settlements wherever
they went. No leader could stand against them, and in a little while
they had wasted all the lower settlements and advanced into the
mountains. The warriors of the old town of
N&#301;kw&#259;s&#301;&prime;, on the head of Little Tennessee,
gathered their wives and children into the townhouse and kept scouts
constantly on the lookout for the presence of danger. One morning just
before daybreak the spies saw the enemy approaching and at once gave
the alarm. The N&#301;kw&#259;s&#301;&prime; men seized their arms and
rushed out to meet the attack, but after a long, hard fight they found
themselves overpowered and began to retreat, when suddenly a stranger
stood among them and shouted to the chief to call off his men and he
himself would drive back the enemy. From the dress and language of the
stranger the N&#301;kw&#259;s&#301;&prime; people thought him a chief
who had come with reinforcements from the Overhill settlements in
Tennessee. They fell back along the trail, and as they came near the
townhouse they saw a great company of warriors coming out from the side
of the mound as through an open doorway. Then they knew that their
friends were the N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;, the Immortals,
although no one had ever heard before that they lived under
N&#301;kw&#259;s&#301;&prime; mound.</p>

</div>
<p>The N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; poured out by hundreds,
armed and painted for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href=
"#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>fight, and the most curious thing
about it all was that they became invisible as soon as they were fairly
outside of the settlement, so that although the enemy saw the glancing
arrow or the rushing tomahawk, and felt the stroke, he could not see
who sent it. Before such invisible foes the invaders soon had to
retreat, going first south along the ridge to where joins the main
ridge which separates the French Broad from the Tuckasegee, and then
turning with it to the northeast. As they retreated they tried to
shield themselves behind rocks and trees, but the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; arrows went around the rocks and
killed them from the other side, and they could find no hiding place.
All along the ridge they fell, until when they reached the head of
Tuckasegee not more than half a dozen were left alive, and in despair
they sat down and cried out for mercy. Ever since then the Cherokee
have called the place Day&ucirc;ls&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Where they cried.&rdquo; Then the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; chief told them they had deserved
their punishment for attacking a peaceful tribe, and he spared their
lives and told them to go home and take the news to their people. This
was the Indian custom, always to spare a few to carry back the news of
defeat. They went home toward the north and the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; went back to the mound.</p>
<p>And they are still there, because, in the last war, when a strong
party of Federal troops came to surprise a handful of Confederates
posted there they saw so many soldiers guarding the town that they were
afraid and went away without making an attack.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>There is another story, that once while all the warriors of a
certain town were off on a hunt, or at a dance in another settlement,
one old man was chopping wood on the side of the ridge when suddenly a
party of the enemy came upon him&mdash;Shawano, Seneca, or some other
tribe. Throwing his hatchet at the nearest one, he turned and ran for
the house to get his gun and make the best defense that he might. On
coming out at once with the gun he was surprised to find a large body
of strange warriors driving back the enemy. It was no time for
questions, and taking his place with the others, they fought hard until
the enemy was pressed back up the creek and finally broke and retreated
across the mountain. When it was over and there was time to breathe
again, the old man turned to thank his new friends, but found that he
was alone&mdash;they had disappeared as though the mountain had
swallowed them. Then he knew that they were the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;, who had come to help their
friends, the Cherokee.</p>

<h4 class="main">81. TSUL&#699;K&#258;L&Ucirc;&prime;, THE SLANT-EYED
GIANT</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A long time ago a widow lived with her one daughter at
the old town of K&#259;nuga on Pigeon river. The girl was of age to
marry, and her mother used to talk with her a good deal, and tell her
she must <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>be sure to take no one but a good hunter for a
husband, so that they would have some one to take care of them and
would always have plenty of meat in the house. The girl said such a man
was hard to find, but her mother advised her not to be in a hurry, and
to wait until the right one came.</p>
<p>Now the mother slept in the house while the girl slept outside in
the &acirc;s&#301;. One dark night a stranger came to the
&acirc;s&#301; wanting to court the girl, but she told him her mother
would let her marry no one but a good hunter. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
the stranger, &ldquo;I am a great hunter,&rdquo; so she let him come
in, and he stayed all night. Just before day he said he must go back
now to his own place, but that he had brought some meat for her mother,
and she would find it outside. Then he went away and the girl had not
seen him. When day came she went out and found there a deer, which she
brought into the house to her mother, and told her it was a present
from her new sweetheart. Her mother was pleased, and they had
deersteaks for breakfast.</p>
<p>He came again the next night, but again went away before daylight,
and this time he left two deer outside. The mother was more pleased
this time, but said to her daughter, &ldquo;I wish your sweetheart
would bring us some wood.&rdquo; Now wherever he might be, the stranger
knew their thoughts, so when he came the next time he said to the girl,
&ldquo;Tell your mother I have brought the wood&rdquo;; and when she
looked out in the morning there were several great trees lying in front
of the door, roots and branches and all. The old woman was angry, and
said, &ldquo;He might have brought us some wood that we could use
instead of whole trees that we can&rsquo;t split, to litter up the road
with brush.&rdquo; The hunter knew what she said, and the next time he
came he brought nothing, and when they looked out in the morning the
trees were gone and there was no wood at all, so the old woman had to
go after some herself.</p>
<p>Almost every night he came to see the girl, and each time he brought
a deer or some other game, but still he always left before daylight. At
last her mother said to her, &ldquo;Your husband always leaves before
daylight. Why don&rsquo;t he wait? I want to see what kind of a
son-in-law I have.&rdquo; When the girl told this to her husband he
said he could not let the old woman see him, because the sight would
frighten her. &ldquo;She wants to see you, anyhow,&rdquo; said the
girl, and began to cry, until at last he had to consent, but warned her
that her mother must not say that he looked frightful
(<i>usga&prime;s&#277;&#699;ti&prime;yu</i>).</p>
<p>The next morning he did not leave so early, but stayed in the
&acirc;s&#301;, and when it was daylight the girl went out and told her
mother. The old woman came and looked in, and there she saw a great
giant, with long slanting eyes
(<i>tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;</i>), lying doubled up on the
floor, with his head against the rafters in the left-hand corner at the
back, and his toes scraping the roof in the right-hand corner by the
door. She <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>gave only one look and ran back to the house,
crying, <i>Usga&prime;s&#277;&#699;ti&prime;yu!
Usga&prime;s&#277;&#699;ti&prime;yu!</i></p>
<p>Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime; was terribly angry. He untwisted
himself and came out of the &acirc;s&#301;, and said good-bye to the
girl, telling her that he would never let her mother see him again, but
would go back to his own country. Then he went off in the direction of
Tsuneg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;.</p>
<p>Soon after he left the girl had her monthly period. There was a very
great flow of blood, and the mother threw it all into the river. One
night after the girl had gone to bed in the &acirc;s&#301; her husband
came again to the door and said to her, &ldquo;It seems you are
alone,&rdquo; and asked where was the child. She said there had been
none. Then he asked where was the blood, and she said that her mother
had thrown it into the river. She told just where the place was, and he
went there and found a small worm in the water. He took it up and
carried it back to the &acirc;s&#301;, and as he walked it took form
and began to grow, until, when he reached the &acirc;s&#301;, it was a
baby girl that he was carrying. He gave it to his wife and said,
&ldquo;Your mother does not like me and abuses our child, so come and
let us go to my home.&rdquo; The girl wanted to be with her husband,
so, after telling her mother good-bye, she took up the child and they
went off together to Tsuneg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;.</p>
<p>Now, the girl had an older brother, who lived with his own wife in
another settlement, and when he heard that his sister was married he
came to pay a visit to her and her new husband, but when he arrived at
K&#259;nuga his mother told him his sister had taken her child and gone
away with her husband, nobody knew where. He was sorry to see his
mother so lonely, so he said he would go after his sister and try to
find her and bring her back. It was easy to follow the footprints of
the giant, and the young man went along the trail until he came to a
place where they had rested, and there were tracks on the ground where
a child had been lying and other marks as if a baby had been born
there. He went on along the trail and came to another place where they
had rested, and there were tracks of a baby crawling about and another
lying on the ground. He went on and came to where they had rested
again, and there were tracks of a child walking and another crawling
about. He went on until he came where they had rested again, and there
were tracks of one child running and another walking. Still he followed
the trail along the stream into the mountains, and came to the place
where they had rested again, and this time there were footprints of two
children running all about, and the footprints can still be seen in the
rock at that place.</p>
<p>Twice again he found where they had rested, and then the trail led
up the slope of Tsuneg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, and he heard the
sound of a drum and voices, as if people were dancing inside the
mountain. Soon he came to a cave like a doorway in the side of the
mountain, but the rock was so steep and smooth that he could not climb
up to it, but could only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href=
"#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span>just look over the edge and see
the heads and shoulders of a great many people dancing inside. He saw
his sister dancing among them and called to her to come out. She turned
when she heard his voice, and as soon as the drumming stopped for a
while she came out to him, finding no trouble to climb down the rock,
and leading her two little children by the hand. She was very glad to
meet her brother and talked with him a long time, but did not ask him
to come inside, and at last he went away without having seen her
husband.</p>
<p>Several other times her brother came to the mountain, but always his
sister met him outside, and he could never see her husband. After four
years had passed she came one day to her mother&rsquo;s house and said
her husband had been hunting in the woods near by, and they were
getting ready to start home to-morrow, and if her mother and brother
would come early in the morning they could see her husband. If they
came too late for that, she said, they would find plenty of meat to
take home. She went back into the woods, and the mother ran to tell her
son. They came to the place early the next morning, but
Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime; and his family were already gone. On
the drying poles they found the bodies of freshly killed deer hanging,
as the girl had promised, and there were so many that they went back
and told all their friends to come for them, and there were enough for
the whole settlement.</p>
<p>Still the brother wanted to see his sister and her husband, so he
went again to the mountain, and she came out to meet him. He asked to
see her husband, and this time she told him to come inside with her.
They went in as through a doorway, and inside he found it like a great
townhouse. They seemed to be alone, but his sister called aloud,
&ldquo;He wants to see you,&rdquo; and from the air came a voice,
&ldquo;You can not see me until you put on a new dress, and then you
can see me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am willing,&rdquo; said the young man,
speaking to the unseen spirit, and from the air came the voice again,
&ldquo;Go back, then, and tell your people that to see me they must go
into the townhouse and fast seven days, and in all that time they must
not come out from the townhouse or raise the war whoop, and on the
seventh day I shall come with new dresses for you to put on so that you
can all see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man went back to K&#259;nuga and told the people. They all
wanted to see Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;, who owned all the game
in the mountains, so they went into the townhouse and began the fast.
They fasted the first day and the second and every day until the
seventh&mdash;all but one man from another settlement, who slipped out
every night when it was dark to get something to eat and slipped in
again when no one was watching. On the morning of the seventh day the
sun was just coming up in the east when they heard a great noise like
the thunder of rocks rolling down the side of
Tsuneg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;. They were frightened and drew near
together in the townhouse, and no one whispered. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=
"pb341">341</a>]</span>Nearer and louder came the sound until it grew
into an awful roar, and every one trembled and held his
breath&mdash;all but one man, the stranger from the other settlement,
who lost his senses from fear and ran out of the townhouse and shouted
the war cry.</p>
<p>At once the roar stopped and for some time there was silence. Then
they heard it again, but as if it were going farther away, and then
farther and farther, until at last it died away in the direction of
Tsuneg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, and then all was still again. The
people came out from the townhouse, but there was silence, and they
could see nothing but what had been seven days before.</p>
<p>Still the brother was not disheartened, but came again to see his
sister, and she brought him into the mountain. He asked why
Tsul&#699;k&acirc;l&ucirc;&prime; had not brought the new dresses, as
he had promised, and the voice from the air said, &ldquo;I came with
them, but you did not obey my word, but broke the fast and raised the
war cry.&rdquo; The young man answered, &ldquo;It was not done by our
people, but by a stranger. If you will come again, we will surely do as
you say.&rdquo; But the voice answered, &ldquo;Now you can never see
me.&rdquo; Then the young man could not say any more, and he went back
to K&#259;nuga.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">82. K&#258;NA&prime;STA, THE LOST SETTLEMENT</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago, while people still lived in the old town of
K&#259;na&prime;sta, on the French Broad, two strangers, who looked in
no way different from other Cherokee, came into the settlement one day
and made their way into the chief&rsquo;s house. After the first
greetings were over the chief asked them from what town they had come,
thinking them from one of the western settlements, but they said,
&ldquo;We are of your people and our town is close at hand, but you
have never seen it. Here you have wars and sickness, with enemies on
every side, and after a while a stronger enemy will come to take your
country from you. We are always happy, and we have come to invite you
to live with us in our town over there,&rdquo; and they pointed toward
Tsuwa&#699;tel&prime;da (Pilot knob). &ldquo;We do not live forever,
and do not always find game when we go for it, for the game belongs to
Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;, who lives in
Tsuneg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, but we have peace always and need
not think of danger. We go now, but if your people will live with us
let them fast seven days, and we shall come then to take them.&rdquo;
Then they went away toward the west.</p>
<p>The chief called his people together into the townhouse and they
held a council over the matter and decided at last to go with the
strangers. They got all their property ready for moving, and then went
again into the townhouse and began their fast. They fasted six days,
and on the morning of the seventh, before yet the sun was high, they
saw a great company coming along the trail from the west, led by the
two men <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>who had stopped with the chief. They seemed just
like Cherokee from another settlement, and after a friendly meeting
they took up a part of the goods to be carried, and the two parties
started back together for Tsuwa&#699;tel&prime;da. There was one man
from another town visiting at K&#259;na&prime;sta, and he went along
with the rest.</p>
<p>When they came to the mountain, the two guides led the way into a
cave, which opened out like a great door in the side of the rock.
Inside they found an open country and a town, with houses ranged in two
long rows from east to west. The mountain people lived in the houses on
the south side, and they had made ready the other houses for the new
comers, but even after all the people of K&#259;na&prime;sta, with
their children and belongings, had moved in, there were still a large
number of houses waiting ready for the next who might come. The
mountain people told them that there was another town, of a different
people, above them in the same mountain, and still farther above, at
the very top, lived the
Ani&prime;-Hy&ucirc;&ntilde;t&#301;kw&#259;l&acirc;&prime;sk&#301; (the
Thunders).</p>
<p>Now all the people of K&#259;na&prime;sta were settled in their new
homes, but the man who had only been visiting with them wanted to go
back to his own friends. Some of the mountain people wanted to prevent
this, but the chief said, &ldquo;No; let him go if he will, and when he
tells his friends they may want to come, too. There is plenty of room
for all.&rdquo; Then he said to the man, &ldquo;Go back and tell your
friends that if they want to come and live with us and be always happy,
there is a place here ready and waiting for them. Others of us live in
Datsu&prime;nal&acirc;sg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301; and in the high
mountains all around, and if they would rather go to any of them it is
all the same. We see you wherever you go and are with you in all your
dances, but you can not see us unless you fast. If you want to see us,
fast four days, and we will come and talk with you; and then if you
want to live with us, fast again seven days, and we will come and take
you.&rdquo; Then the chief led the man through the cave to the outside
of the mountain and left him there, but when the man looked back he saw
no cave, but only the solid rock.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The people of the lost settlement were never seen again, and they
are still living in Tsuwa&#699;tel&prime;da. Strange things happen
there, so that the Cherokee know the mountain is haunted and do not
like to go near it. Only a few years ago a party of hunters camped
there, and as they sat around their fire at supper time they talked of
the story and made rough jokes about the people of old
K&#259;na&prime;sta. That night they were aroused from sleep by a noise
as of stones thrown at them from among the trees, but when they
searched they could find nobody, and were so frightened that they
gathered up their guns and pouches and left the place. <span class=

<h4 class="main">83. TSUWE&prime;N&#258;H&#300;: A LEGEND OF PILOT
KNOB</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the old town of K&#259;nuga, on Pigeon river, there
was a lazy fellow named Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301;, who lived from
house to house among his relatives and never brought home any game,
although he used to spend nearly all his time in the woods. At last his
friends got very tired of keeping him, so he told them to get some
parched corn ready for him and he would go and bring back a deer or
else would never trouble them again. They filled his pouch with parched
corn, enough for a long trip, and he started off for the mountains. Day
after day passed until they thought they had really seen the last of
him, but before the month was half gone he was back again at
K&#259;nuga, with no deer, but with a wonderful story to tell.</p>
<p>He said that he had hardly turned away from the trail to go up the
ridge when he met a stranger, who asked him where he was going.
Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301; answered that his friends in the settlement
had driven him out because he was no good hunter, and that if he did
not find a deer this time he would never go back again. &ldquo;Why not
come with me?&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;my town is not far from
here, and you have relatives there.&rdquo; Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301;
was very glad of the chance, because he was ashamed to go back to his
own town; so he went with the stranger, who took him to
Tsuwa&#699;tel&prime;da (Pilot knob). They came to a cave, and the
other said, &ldquo;Let us go in here;&rdquo; but the cave ran clear to
the heart of the mountain, and when they were inside the hunter found
there an open country like a wide bottom land, with a great settlement
and hundreds of people. They were all glad to see him, and brought him
to their chief, who took him into his own house and showed him a seat
near the fire. Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301; sat down, but he felt it move
under him, and when he looked again he saw that it was a turtle, with
its head sticking out from the shell. He jumped up, but the chief said,
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt you; it only wants to see who you
are.&rdquo; So he sat down very carefully, and the turtle drew in its
head again. They brought food, of the same kind that he had been
accustomed to at home, and when he had eaten the chief took him through
the settlement until he had seen all the houses and talked with most of
the people. When he had seen everything and had rested some days, he
was anxious to get back to his home, so the chief himself brought him
to the mouth of the cave and showed him the trail that led down to the
river. Then he said, &ldquo;You are going back to the settlement, but
you will never be satisfied there any more. Whenever you want to come
to us, you know the way.&rdquo; The chief left him, and
Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301; went down the mountain and along the river
until he came to K&#259;nuga.</p>
<p>He told his story, but no one believed it and the people only
laughed at him. After that he would go away very often and be gone for
several days at a time, and when he came back to the settlement he
would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>say he had been with the mountain people. At
last one man said he believed the story and would go with him to see.
They went off together to the woods, where they made a camp, and then
Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301; went on ahead, saying he would be back soon.
The other waited for him, doing a little hunting near the camp, and two
nights afterwards Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301; was back again. He seemed
to be alone, but was talking as he came, and the other hunter heard
girls&rsquo; voices, although he could see no one. When he came up to
the fire he said, &ldquo;I have two friends with me, and they say there
is to be a dance in their town in two nights, and if you want to go
they will come for you.&rdquo; The hunter agreed at once, and
Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301; called out, as if to some one close by,
&ldquo;He says he will go.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Our sisters have
come for some venison.&rdquo; The hunter had killed a deer and had the
meat drying over the fire, so he said, &ldquo;What kind do they
want?&rdquo; The voices answered, &ldquo;Our mother told us to ask for
some of the ribs,&rdquo; but still he could see nothing. He took down
some rib pieces and gave them to Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301;, who took
them and said, &ldquo;In two days we shall come again for you.&rdquo;
Then he started off, and the other heard the voices going through the
woods until all was still again.</p>
<p>In two days Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301; came, and this time he had
two girls with him. As they stood near the fire the hunter noticed that
their feet were short and round, almost like dogs&rsquo; paws, but as
soon as they saw him looking they sat down so that he could not see
their feet. After supper the whole party left the camp and went up
along the creek to Tsuwa&#699;tel&prime;da. They went in through the
cave door until they got to the farther end and could see houses
beyond, when all at once the hunter&rsquo;s legs felt as if they were
dead and he staggered and fell to the ground. The others lifted him up,
but still he could not stand, until the medicine-man brought some
&ldquo;old tobacco&rdquo; and rubbed it on his legs and made him smell
it until he sneezed. Then he was able to stand again and went in with
the others. He could not stand at first, because he had not prepared
himself by fasting before he started.</p>
<p>The dance had not yet begun and Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301; took the
hunter into the townhouse and showed him a seat near the fire, but it
had long thorns of honey locust sticking out from it and he was afraid
to sit down. Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301; told him not to be afraid, so
he sat down and found that the thorns were as soft as down feathers.
Now the drummer came in and the dancers, and the dance began. One man
followed at the end of the line, crying <i>K&ucirc;! K&ucirc;!</i> all
the time, but not dancing. The hunter wondered, and they told him,
&ldquo;This man was lost in the mountains and had been calling all
through the woods for his friends until his, voice failed and he was
only able to pant <i>K&ucirc;! K&ucirc;!</i> and then we found him and
took him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When it was over Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301; and the hunter went back
to the settlement. At the next dance in K&#259;nuga they told all they
had seen at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>Tsuwa&#699;tel&prime;da, what a large town was
there and how kind everybody was, and this time&mdash;because there
were two of them&mdash;the people believed it. Now others wanted to go,
but Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301; told them they must first fast seven
days, while he went ahead to prepare everything, and then he would come
and bring them. He went away and the others fasted, until at the end of
seven days he came for them and they went with him to
Tsuwa&#699;tel&prime;da, and their friends in the settlement never saw
them again.</p>

<h4 class="main">84. THE MAN WHO MARRIED THE THUNDER&rsquo;S
SISTER</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the old times the people used to dance often and
all night. Once there was a dance at the old town of
S&acirc;kwi&prime;y&#301;, on the head of Chattahoochee, and after it
was well started two young women with beautiful long hair came in, but
no one knew who they were or whence they had come. They danced with one
partner and another, and in the morning slipped away before anyone knew
that they were gone; but a young warrior had fallen in love with one of
the sisters on account of her beautiful hair, and after the manner of
the Cherokee had already asked her through an old man if she would
marry him and let him live with her. To this the young woman had
replied that her brother at home must first be consulted, and they
promised to return for the next dance seven days later with an answer,
but in the meantime if the young man really loved her he must prove his
constancy by a rigid fast until then. The eager lover readily agreed
and impatiently counted the days.</p>
<p>In seven nights there was another dance. The young warrior was on
hand early, and later in the evening the two sisters appeared as
suddenly as before. They told him their brother was willing, and after
the dance they would conduct the young man to their home, but warned
him that if he told anyone where he went or what he saw he would surely
die.</p>
<p>He danced with them again and about daylight the three came away
just before the dance closed, so as to avoid being followed, and
started off together. The women led the way along a trail through the
woods, which the young man had never noticed before, until they came to
a small creek, where, without hesitating, they stepped into the water.
The young man paused in surprise on the bank and thought to himself,
&ldquo;They are walking in the water; I don&rsquo;t want to do
that.&rdquo; The women knew his thoughts just as though he had spoken
and turned and said to him, &ldquo;This is not water; this is the road
to our house.&rdquo; He still hesitated, but they urged him on until he
stepped into the water and found it was only soft grass that made a
fine level trail.</p>
<p>They went on until the trail came to a large stream which he knew
for Tallulah river. The women plunged boldly in, but again the warrior
hesitated on the bank, thinking to himself, &ldquo;That water is very
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>deep and will drown me; I can&rsquo;t go
on.&rdquo; They knew his thoughts and turned and said, &ldquo;This is
no water, but the main trail that goes past our house, which is now
close by.&rdquo; He stepped in, and instead of water there was tall
waving grass that closed above his head as he followed them.</p>
<p>They went only a short distance and came to a rock cave close under
Ug&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301; (Tallulah falls). The women entered,
while the warrior stopped at the mouth; but they said, &ldquo;This is
our house; come in and our brother will soon be home; he is coming
now.&rdquo; They heard low thunder in the distance. He went inside and
stood up close to the entrance. Then the women took off their long hair
and hung it up on a rock, and both their heads were as smooth as a
pumpkin. The man thought, &ldquo;It is not hair at all,&rdquo; and he
was more frightened than ever.</p>
<p>The younger woman, the one he was about to marry, then sat down and
told him to take a seat beside her. He looked, and it was a large
turtle, which raised itself up and stretched out its claws as if angry
at being disturbed. The young man said it was a turtle, and refused to
sit down, but the woman insisted that it was a seat. Then there was a
louder roll of thunder and the woman said, &ldquo;Now our brother is
nearly home.&rdquo; While they urged and he still refused to come
nearer or sit down, suddenly there was a great thunder clap just behind
him, and turning quickly he saw a man standing in the doorway of the
cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my brother,&rdquo; said the woman, and he came in and
sat down upon the turtle, which again rose up and stretched out its
claws. The young warrior still refused to come in. The brother then
said that he was just about to start to a council, and invited the
young man to go with him. The hunter said he was willing to go if only
he had a horse; so the young woman was told to bring one. She went out
and soon came back leading a great uktena snake, that curled and
twisted along the whole length of the cave. Some people say this was a
white uktena and that the brother himself rode a red one. The hunter
was terribly frightened, and said &ldquo;That is a snake; I can&rsquo;t
ride that.&rdquo; The others insisted that it was no snake, but their
riding-horse. The brother grew impatient and said to the woman,
&ldquo;He may like it better if you bring him a saddle, and some
bracelets for his wrists and arms.&rdquo; So they went out again and
brought in a saddle and some arm bands, and the saddle was another
turtle, which they fastened on the uktena&rsquo;s back, and the
bracelets were living slimy snakes, which they got ready to twist
around the hunter&rsquo;s wrists.</p>
<p>He was almost dead with fear, and said, &ldquo;What kind of horrible
place is this? I can never stay here to live with snakes and creeping
things.&rdquo; The brother got very angry and called him a coward, and
then it was as if lightening flashed from his eyes and struck the young
man, and a terrible crash of thunder stretched him senseless.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name=
"pb347">347</a>]</span></p>
<p>When at last he came to himself again he was standing with his feet
in the water and both hands grasping a laurel bush that grew out from
the bank, and there was no trace of the cave or the Thunder People, but
he was alone in the forest. He made his way out and finally reached his
own settlement, but found then that he had been gone so very long that
all the people had thought him dead, although to him it seemed only the
day after the dance. His friends questioned him closely, and,
forgetting the warning, he told the story; but in seven days he died,
for no one can come back from the underworld and tell it and live.</p>

<h4 class="main">85. THE HAUNTED WHIRLPOOL</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the mouth of Suck creek, on the Tennessee, about 8
miles below Chattanooga, is a series of dangerous whirlpools, known as
&ldquo;The Suck,&rdquo; and noted among the Cherokee as the place where
&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime;, the gambler, lived long ago (see the
story). They call it &Ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;tiguh&#301;&prime;,
&ldquo;Pot-in-the-water,&rdquo; on account of the appearance of the
surging, tumbling water, suggesting a boiling pot. They assert that in
the old times the whirlpools were intermittent in character, and the
canoemen attempting to pass the spot used to hug the bank, keeping
constantly on the alert for signs of a coming eruption, and when they
saw the water begin to revolve more rapidly would stop and wait until
it became quiet again before attempting to proceed.</p>
<p>It happened once that two men, going down the river in a canoe, as
they came near this place saw the water circling rapidly ahead of them.
They pulled up to the bank to wait until it became smooth again, but
the whirlpool seemed to approach with wider and wider circles, until
they were drawn into the vortex. They were thrown out of the canoe and
carried down under the water, where one man was seized by a great fish
and was never seen again. The other was taken round and round down to
the very lowest center of the whirlpool, when another circle caught him
and bore him outward and upward until he was finally thrown up again to
the surface and floated out into the shallow water, whence he made his
escape to shore. He told afterwards that when he reached the narrowest
circle of the maelstrom the water seemed to open below him and he could
look down as through the roof beams of a house, and there on the bottom
of the river he had seen a great company of people, who looked up and
beckoned to him to join them, but as they put up their hands to seize
him the swift current caught him and took him out of their reach.</p>

<h4 class="main">86. YAHULA</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Yahoola creek, which flows by Dahlonega, in Lumpkin
county, Georgia, is called Yahul&acirc;&prime;&#301; (Yahula place) by
the Cherokees, and this is the story of the name: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span></p>
<p>Years ago, long before the Revolution, Yahula was a prosperous stock
trader among the Cherokee, and the tinkling of the bells hung around
the necks of his ponies could be heard on every mountain trail. Once
there was a great hunt and all the warriors were out, but when it was
over and they were ready to return to the settlement Yahula was not
with them. They waited and searched, but he could not be found, and at
last they went back without him, and his friends grieved for him as for
one dead. Some time after his people were surprised and delighted to
have him walk in among them and sit down as they were at supper in the
evening. To their questions he told them that he had been lost in the
mountains, and that the N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;, the
Immortals, had found him and brought him to their town, where he had
been kept ever since, with the kindest care and treatment, until the
longing to see his old friends had brought him back. To the invitation
of his friends to join them at supper he said that it was now too
late&mdash;he had tasted the fairy food and could never again eat with
human kind, and for the same reason he could not stay with his family,
but must go back to the N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;. His wife
and children and brother begged him to stay, but he said that he could
not; it was either life with the Immortals or death with his own
people&mdash;and after some further talk he rose to go. They saw him as
he sat talking to them and as he stood up, but the moment he stepped
out the doorway he vanished as if he had never been.</p>
<p>After that he came back often to visit his people. They would see
him first as he entered the house, and while he sat and talked he was
his old self in every way, but the instant he stepped across the
threshold he was gone, though a hundred eyes might be watching. He came
often, but at last their entreaties grew so urgent that the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; must have been offended, and he
came no more. On the mountain at the head of the creek, about 10 miles
above the present Dahlonega, is a small square inclosure of uncut
stone, without roof or entrance. Here it was said that he lived, so the
Cherokee called it Yahul&acirc;&prime;&#301; and called the stream by
the same name. Often at night a belated traveler coming along the trail
by the creek would hear the voice of Yahula singing certain favorite
old songs that he used to like to sing as he drove his pack of horses
across the mountain, the sound of a voice urging them on, and the crack
of a whip and the tinkling of bells went with the song, but neither
driver nor horses could be seen, although the sounds passed close by.
The songs and the bells were heard only at night.</p>
<p>There was one man who had been his friend, who sang the same songs
for a time after Yahula had disappeared, but he died suddenly, and then
the Cherokee were afraid to sing these songs any more until it was so
long since anyone had heard the sounds on the mountain that they
thought Yahula must be gone away, perhaps to the West, where others of
the tribe had already gone. It is so long ago now that even
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=
"pb349">349</a>]</span>the stone house may have been destroyed by this
time, but more than one old man&rsquo;s father saw it and heard the
songs and the bells a hundred years ago. When the Cherokee went from
Georgia to Indian Territory in 1838 some of them said, &ldquo;Maybe
Yahula has gone there and we shall hear him,&rdquo; but they have never
heard him again.</p>

<h4 class="main">87. THE WATER CANNIBALS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Besides the friendly
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; of the streams and mountains
there is a race of cannibal spirits, who stay at the bottom of the deep
rivers and live upon human flesh, especially that of little children.
They come out just after daybreak and go about unseen from house to
house until they find some one still asleep, when they shoot him with
their invisible arrows and carry the dead body down under the water to
feast upon it. That no one may know what has happened they leave in
place of the body a shade or image of the dead man or little child,
that wakes up and talks and goes about just as he did, but there is no
life in it, and in seven days it withers and dies, and the people bury
it and think they are burying their dead friend. It was a long time
before the people found out about this, but now they always try to be
awake at daylight and wake up the children, telling them &ldquo;The
hunters are among you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the way they first knew about the water cannibals: There was
a man in T&#301;kw&#259;li&prime;ts&#301; town who became sick and grew
worse until the doctors said he could not live, and then his friends
went away from the house and left him alone to die<span class="corr"
id="xd25e10260" title="Source: ,">.</span> They were not so kind to
each other in the old times as they are now, because they were afraid
of the witches that came to torment dying people.</p>
<p>He was alone several days, not able to rise from his bed, when one
morning an old woman came in at the door. She looked just like the
other women of the settlement, but he did not know her. She came over
to the bed and said, &ldquo;You are very sick and your friends seem to
have left you. Come with me and I will make you well.&rdquo; The man
was so near death that he could not move, but now her words made him
feel stronger at once, and he asked her where she wanted him to go.
&ldquo;We live close by; come with me and I will show you,&rdquo; said
the woman, so he got up from his bed and she led the way down to the
water. When she came to the water she stepped in and he followed, and
there was a road under the water, and another country there just like
that above.</p>
<p>They went on until they came to a settlement with a great many
houses, and women going about their work and children playing. They met
a party of hunters coming in from a hunt, but instead of deer or bear
quarters hanging from their shoulders they carried the bodies of dead
men and children, and several of the bodies the man knew for those of
his own friends in T&#301;kw&#259;li&prime;ts&#301;. They came to a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>house and the woman said &ldquo;This is where I
live,&rdquo; and took him in and fixed a bed for him and made him
comfortable.</p>
<p>By this time he was very hungry, but the woman knew his thoughts and
said, &ldquo;We must get him something to eat.&rdquo; She took one of
the bodies that the hunters had just brought in and cut off a slice to
roast. The man was terribly frightened, but she read his thoughts again
and said, &ldquo;I see you can not eat our food.&rdquo; Then she turned
away from him and held her hands before her
stomach&mdash;<i>so</i>&mdash;and when she turned around again she had
them full of bread and beans such as he used to have at home.</p>
<p>So it was every day, until soon he was well and strong again. Then
she told him he might go home now, but he must be sure not to speak to
anyone for seven days, and if any of his friends should question him he
must make signs as if his throat were sore and keep silent. She went
with him along the same trail to the water&rsquo;s edge, and the water
closed over her and he went back alone to
T&#301;kw&#259;li&prime;ts&#301;. When he came there his friends were
surprised, because they thought he had wandered off and died in the
woods. They asked him where he had been, but he only pointed to his
throat and said nothing, so they thought he was not yet well and let
him alone until the seven days were past, when he began to talk again
and told the whole story.</p>

<h4 class="main">88. FIRST CONTACT WITH WHITES</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are a few stories concerning the first contact
of the Cherokee with whites and negroes. They are very modern and have
little value as myths, but throw some light upon the Indian estimate of
the different races.</p>
<p>One story relates how the first whites came from the east and tried
to enter into friendly relations, but the Indians would have nothing to
do with them for a long time. At last the whites left a jug of whisky
and a dipper near a spring frequented by the Indians. The Indians came
along, tasted the liquor, which they had never known before, and liked
it so well that they ended by all getting comfortably drunk. While they
were in this happy frame of mind some white men came up, and this time
the Indians shook hands with them and they have been friends after a
fashion ever since. This may possibly be a Cherokee adaptation of the
story of Hudson&rsquo;s first landing on the island of Manhattan.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>At the creation an ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301; was given
to the white man, and a piece of silver to the Indian. But the white
man despised the stone and threw it away, while the Indian did the same
with the silver. In going about the white man afterward found the
silver piece and put it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href=
"#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span>into his pocket and has prized it
ever since. The Indian, in like manner, found the
ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301; where the white man had thrown
it. He picked it up and has kept it since as his talisman, as money is
the talismanic power of the white man. This story is quite general and
is probably older than others of its class.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>When Sequoya, the inventor of the Cherokee alphabet, was trying to
introduce it among his people, about 1822, some of them opposed it upon
the ground that Indians had no business with reading. They said that
when the Indian and the white man were created, the Indian, being the
elder, was given a book, while the white man received a bow and arrows.
Each was instructed to take good care of his gift and make the best use
of it, but the Indian was so neglectful of his book that the white man
soon stole it from him, leaving the bow in its place, so that books and
reading now belong of right to the white man, while the Indian ought to
be satisfied to hunt for a living.&mdash;<i>Cherokee Advocate</i>,
October 26, 1844.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The negro made the first locomotive for a toy and put it on a wooden

watched until he saw how to run it, and then killed the negro and took
the locomotive for himself. This, also, although plainly of very recent
origin, was heard from several informants.</p>

<h4 class="main">89. THE IROQUOIS WARS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long wars were waged between the Cherokee and their
remote northern relatives, the Iroquois, with both of whom the
recollection, now nearly faded, was a vivid tradition fifty years ago.
The (Seneca) Iroquois know the Cherokee as
Oyada&#700;ge&#699;o&ntilde;no&ntilde;, a name rather freely rendered
&ldquo;cave people.&rdquo; The latter call the Iroquois, or rather
their largest and most aggressive tribe, the Seneca,
N&ucirc;nd&#259;we&prime;g&#301;,
Ani&prime;-N&ucirc;n-d&#259;we&prime;g&#301;, or
Ani&prime;-S&#277;&prime;nik&#259;, the first forms being derived from
N&ucirc;ndawa&prime;ga or N&ucirc;ndawa&prime;-ono, &ldquo;people of
the great hills,&rdquo; the name by which the Seneca know themselves.
According to authorities quoted by Schoolcraft, the Seneca claim to
have at one time had a settlement, from which they were afterward
driven, at Seneca, South Carolina, known in history as one of the
principal towns of the Lower Cherokee.</p>
<p>The league of the Iroquois was probably founded about the middle of
the sixteenth century. Before 1680 they had conquered or exterminated
all the tribes upon their immediate borders and had turned their arms
against the more distant Illinois, Catawba, and Cherokee. According to
Iroquois tradition, the Cherokee were the aggressors, having attacked
and plundered a Seneca hunting party somewhere in the west, while in
another story they are represented as having violated a peace treaty by
the murder of the Iroquois delegates. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb352" href="#pb352" name="pb352">352</a>]</span>Whatever the cause,
the war was taken up by all the tribes of the league.</p>
<p>From the Iroquois country to the Cherokee frontier was considered a
five days&rsquo; journey for a rapidly traveling war party. As the
distance was too great for large expeditions, the war consisted chiefly
of a series of individual exploits, a single Cherokee often going
hundreds of miles to strike a blow, which was sure to be promptly
retaliated by the warriors from the north, the great object of every
Iroquois boy being to go against the Cherokee as soon as he was old
enough to take the war path. Captives were made on both sides, and
probably in about equal numbers, the two parties being too evenly
matched for either to gain any permanent advantage, and a compromise
was finally made by which the Tennessee river came to be regarded as
the boundary between their rival claims, all south of that stream being
claimed by the Cherokee, and being acknowledged by the Iroquois, as the
limit of their own conquests in that direction. This Indian boundary
was recognized by the British government up to the time of the
Revolution.</p>
<p>Morgan states that a curious agreement was once made between the two
tribes, by which this river was also made the limit of pursuit. If a
returning war party of the Cherokee could recross the Tennessee before
they were overtaken by the pursuing Iroquois they were as safe from
attack as though entrenched behind a stockade. The pursuers, if they
chose, might still invade the territory of the enemy, but they passed
by the camp of the retreating Cherokee without offering to attack them.
A similar agreement existed for a time between the Seneca and the
Erie.</p>
<p>The Buffalo dance of the Iroquois is traditionally said to have had
its origin in an expedition against the Cherokee. When the warriors on
their way to the south reached the Kentucky salt lick they found there
a herd of buffalo, and heard them, for the first time, &ldquo;singing
their favorite songs,&rdquo; i. e., bellowing and snorting. From the
bellowing and the movements of the animals were derived the music and
action of the dance.</p>
<p>According to Cherokee tradition, as given by the chief Stand Watie,
the war was finally brought to an end by the Iroquois, who sent a
delegation to the Cherokee to propose a general alliance of the
southern and western tribes. The Cherokee accepted the proposition, and
in turn sent out invitations to the other tribes, all of which entered
into the peace excepting the Osage, of whom it was therefore said that
they should be henceforth like a wild fruit on the prairie, at which
every bird should pick, and so the Osage have remained ever a predatory
tribe without friends or allies. This may be the same treaty described
in the story of &ldquo;The Seneca Peacemakers.&rdquo; A formal and
final peace between the two tribes was arranged through the efforts of
the British agent, Sir William Johnson, in 1768. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span></p>
<p>In 1847 there were still living among the Seneca the grandchildren
of Cherokee captives taken in these wars. In 1794 the Seneca pointed
out to Colonel Pickering a chief who was a native Cherokee, having been
taken when a boy and adopted among the Seneca, who afterward made him
chief. This was probably the same man of whom they told Schoolcraft
fifty years later. He was a full-blood Cherokee, but had been captured
when too young to have any memory of the event. Years afterward, when
he had grown to manhood and had become a chief in the tribe, he learned
of his foreign origin, and was filled at once with an overpowering
longing to go back to the south to find his people and live and die
among them. He journeyed to the Cherokee country, but on arriving there
found to his great disappointment that the story of his capture had
been forgotten in the tribe, and that his relatives, if any were left,
failed to recognize him. Being unable to find his kindred, he made only
a short visit and returned again to the Seneca.</p>
<p>From James Wafford, of Indian Territory, the author obtained a
detailed account of the Iroquois peace embassy referred to by Stand
Watie, and of the wampum belt that accompanied it. Wafford&rsquo;s
information concerning the proceedings at Echota was obtained directly
from two eyewitnesses&mdash;Sequoya, the inventor of the alphabet, and
Gat&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;wa&#699;l&#301;, &ldquo;Hard-mush,&rdquo; who
afterward explained the belt at the great council near Tahlequah
seventy years later. Sequoya, at the time of the Echota conference, was
a boy living with his mother at Taskigi town a few miles away, while
Gat&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;wa&#699;l&#301; was already a young man.</p>
<p>The treaty of peace between the Cherokee and Iroquois, made at
Johnson Hall in New York in 1768, appears from the record to have been
brought about by the Cherokee, who sent for the purpose a delegation of
chiefs, headed by &Acirc;g&#259;nst&acirc;&prime;ta,
&ldquo;Groundhog-sausage,&rdquo; of Echota, their great leader in the
war of 1760&ndash;61 against the English. After the treaty had been
concluded the Cherokee delegates invited some of the Iroquois chiefs to
go home with them for a visit, but the latter declined on the ground
that it was not yet safe, and in fact some of their warriors were at
that very time out against the Cherokee, not yet being aware of the
peace negotiations. It is probable, therefore, that the Iroquois
delegates did not arrive at Echota until some considerable time,
perhaps three years, after the formal preliminaries had been concluded
in the north.</p>
<p>According to Sequoya&rsquo;s account, as given to Wafford, there had
been a long war between the Cherokee and the northern Indians, who were
never able to conquer the Cherokee or break their spirit, until at last
the Iroquois were tired of fighting and sent a delegation to make
peace. The messengers set out for the south with their wampum belts and
peace emblems, but lost their way after passing Tennessee <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name=
"pb354">354</a>]</span>river, perhaps from the necessity of avoiding
the main trail, and instead of arriving at Its&acirc;&prime;t&#301; or
Echota, the ancient peace town and capital of the Cherokee
Nation&mdash;situated on Little Tennessee river below Citico creek, in
the present Monroe county, Tennessee&mdash;they found themselves on the
outskirts of T&#259;&prime;likw&#259;&prime; or Tellico, on Tellico
river, some 10 or 15 miles to the southward.</p>

Above this group is another, claiming to bear date about 1608, when Champlain joined the Algonquins against the Iroquois.&rdquo;&mdash;Carrington, in Six Nations of New York, Extra Bulletin, Eleventh Census, pp. 33&ndash;34, 1892."

</div>
<p>Concealing themselves in the neighborhood, they sent one of their
number into the town to announce their coming. As it happened the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span>chief and his family were at work in their
cornfield, and his daughter had just gone up to the house for some
reason when the Iroquois entered and asked for something to eat. Seeing
that he was a stranger, she set out food for him according to the old
custom of hospitality. While he was eating her father, the chief, came
in to see what was delaying her, and was surprised to find there one of
the hereditary enemies of his tribe. By this time the word had gone out
that an Iroquois was in the chief&rsquo;s house, and the men of the
town had left their work and seized their guns to kill him, but the
chief heard them coming and standing in the doorway kept them off,
saying: &ldquo;This man has come here on a peace mission, and before
you kill him you must first kill me.&rdquo; They finally listened to
him, and allowed the messenger to go out and bring his companions to
the chief&rsquo;s house, where they were all taken care of.</p>
<p>When they were well rested after their long journey the chief of
T&#259;&prime;likw&#259; himself went with them to
Its&acirc;&prime;t&#301;, the capital, where lived the great chief
&Acirc;g&#259;nst&acirc;&prime;ta, who was now the civil ruler of the
Nation. The chiefs of the various towns were summoned and a council was
held, at which the speaker for the Iroquois delegation delivered his
message and produced the wampum belts and pipes, which they brought as
proofs of their mission and had carried all the way in packs upon their
backs.</p>
<p>He said that for three years his people had been wanting to make
peace. There was a spring of dark, cloudy water in their country, and
they had covered it over for one year and then looked, but the water
was still cloudy. Again they had covered it over, but when they looked
at the end of another year it was still dark and troubled. For another
year they had covered the spring, and this time when they looked the
water was clear and sparkling. Then they knew the time had come, and
they left home with their wampum belts to make peace with their
enemies.</p>
<p>The friendly message was accepted by the Cherokee, and the belts and
other symbolic peace tokens were delivered over to their keeping. Other
belts in turn were probably given to the Iroquois, and after the usual
round of feasting and dancing the messengers returned to their people
in the north and the long war was at an end.</p>
<p>For nearly a century these symbolic records of the peace with the
Iroquois were preserved by the Cherokee, and were carried with them to
the western territory when the tribe was finally driven from its old
home in 1838. They were then in the keeping of John Ross, principal
chief at the time of the removal, and were solemnly produced at a great
intertribal council held near Tahlequah, in the Indian Territory, in
June, 1843, when they were interpreted by the Cherokee speaker,
Gat&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;wa&#699;l&#301;, &ldquo;Hard-mush,&rdquo; who
had seen them delivered to the chiefs of his tribe at old
Its&acirc;&prime;t&#301; seventy years before. Wafford was present on
this occasion and describes it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356"
href="#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span></p>
<p>Holding the belts over his arm while speaking, Hard-mush told of the
original treaty with the Iroquois, and explained the meaning of each
belt in turn. According to the best of Wafford&rsquo;s recollection,
there was one large belt, to which the smaller belts were fitted. The
beads did not seem to be of shell, and may have been of porcelain.
There were also red pipes for the warriors, grayish-white pipes for the
chiefs who were foremost in making the peace, and some fans or other
ornaments of feathers. There were several of the red pipes, resembling
the red-stone pipes of the Sioux, but only one, or perhaps two, of the
white peace pipes, which may have been only painted, and were much
larger than the others. The pipes were passed around the circle at the
council, so that each delegate might take a whiff. The objects
altogether made a considerable package, which was carefully guarded by
the Cherokee keeper. It is thought that they were destroyed in the War
of the Rebellion when the house of John Ross, a few miles south of
Tahlequah, was burned by the Confederate Cherokee under their general,
Stand Watie.</p>

<h4 class="main">90. HIADEONI, THE SENECA</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Hiadeoni was the father of the late chief
Young-king. He was a Seneca warrior, a man of great prowess, dexterity,
and swiftness of foot, and had established his reputation for courage
and skill on many occasions. He resolved while the Seneca were still
living on the Genesee river to make an incursion alone into the country
of the Cherokee. He plumed himself with the idea that he could
distinguish himself in this daring adventure, and he prepared for it,
according to the custom of warriors. They never encumber themselves
with baggage. He took nothing but his arms and the meal of a little
parched and pounded corn. The forest gave him his meat.</p>
<p>Hiadeoni reached the confines of the Cherokee country in safety and
alone. He waited for evening before he entered the precincts of a
village. He found the people engaged in a dance. He watched his
opportunity, and when one of the dancers went out from the ring into
the bushes he dispatched him with his hatchet. In this way he killed
two men that night in the skirts of the woods without exciting alarm,
and took their scalps and retreated. It was late when he came to a
lodge, standing remote from the rest, on his course homeward. Watching
here, he saw a young man come out, and killed him as he had done the
others, and took his scalp. Looking into the lodge cautiously he saw it
empty, and ventured in with the hope of finding some tobacco and
ammunition to serve him on his way home.</p>
<p>While thus busied in searching the lodge he heard footsteps at the
door, and immediately threw himself on the bed from which the young man
had risen, and covered his face, feigning sleep. They proved to be the
footsteps of his last victim&rsquo;s mother. She, supposing him to be
her son, whom she had a short time before left lying there, said,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>&ldquo;My son, I am going to such a place, and
will not be back till morning.&rdquo; He made a suitable response, and
the old woman went out. Insensibly he fell asleep, and knew nothing
till morning, when the first thing he heard was the mother&rsquo;s
voice. She, careful for her son, was at the fireplace very early,
pulling some roasted squashes out of the ashes, and after putting them
out, and telling him she left them for him to eat, she went away. He
sprang up instantly and fled; but the early dawn had revealed his
inroad, and he was hotly pursued. Light of foot, and having the start,
he succeeded in reaching and concealing himself in a remote piece of
woods, where he laid till night, and then pursued his way toward the
Genesee, which, in due time he reached, bringing his three Cherokee
scalps as trophies of his victory and
prowess.&rdquo;&mdash;Schoolcraft, Notes on Iroquois, p. 253, 1847.</p>

<h4 class="main">91. THE TWO MOHAWKS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;In the year 1747 a couple of the Mohawk Indians
came against the lower towns of the Cheerake, and so cunningly
ambuscaded them through most part of the spring and summer, as to kill
above twenty in different attacks before they were discovered by any
party of the enraged and dejected people. They had a thorough knowledge
of the most convenient ground for their purpose, and were extremely
swift and long-winded. Whenever they killed any and got the scalp they
made off to the neighboring mountains, and ran over the broad ledges of
rocks in contrary courses, as occasion offered, so as the pursuers
could by no means trace them. Once, when a large company was in chase
of them, they ran round a steep hill at the head of the main eastern
branch of Savana river, intercepted, killed, and scalped the hindmost
of the party, and then made off between them and Keeowhee. As this was
the town to which the company belonged, they hastened home in a close
body, as the proper place of security from such enemy wizards. In this
manner did those two sprightly, gallant savages perplex and intimidate
their foes for the space of four moons in the greatest security, though
they often were forced to kill and barbecue what they chiefly lived
upon, in the midst of their watchful enemies. Having sufficiently
revenged their relations&rsquo; blood and gratified their own ambition
with an uncommon number of scalps, they resolved to captivate one and
run home with him as a proof of their having killed none but the
enemies of their country. Accordingly, they approached very near to
Keeowhee, about half a mile below the late Fort Prince George.
Advancing with the usual caution on such an occasion, one crawled along
under the best cover of the place about the distance of a hundred yards
ahead, while the other shifted from tree to tree, looking sharply every
way. In the evening, however, an old, beloved man discovered them from
the top of an adjoining hill, and knew them to be enemies by the cut of
their hair, light trim for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href=
"#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>running, and their postures. He
returned to the town and called first at the house of one of our
traders and informed him of the affair, enjoining him not to mention it
to any, lest the people should set off against them without success
before their tracks were to be discovered and he be charged with having
deceived them. But, contrary to the true policy of traders among
unforgiving savages, that thoughtless member of the Choktah Sphynx
Company busied himself, as usual, out of his proper sphere, sent for
the headmen, and told them the story. As the Mohawks were allies and
not known to molest any of the traders in the paths and woods, he ought
to have observed a strict neutrality. The youth of the town, by order
of their headmen, carried on their noisy public diversions in their
usual manner to prevent their foes from having any suspicion of their
danger, while runners were sent from the town to their neighbors to
come silently and assist them to secure the prey in its state of
security. They came like silent ghosts, concerted their plan of
operation, passed over the river at the old trading ford opposite to
the late fort, which lay between two contiguous commanding hills, and,
proceeding downward over a broad creek, formed a large semicircle from
the river bank, while the town seemed to be taking its usual rest. They
then closed into a narrower compass, and at last discovered the two
brave, unfortunate men lying close under the tops of some fallen young
pine trees. The company gave the war signal, and the Mohawks, bounding
up, bravely repeated it; but, by their sudden spring from under thick
cover, their arms were useless. They made desperate efforts, however,
to kill or be killed, as their situation required. One of the Cheerake,
the noted half-breed of Istanare [Ust&#259;na&prime;l&#301;] town,
which lay 2 miles from thence, was at the first onset knocked down and
almost killed with his own cutlass, which was wrested from him, though
he was the strongest of the whole nation. But they were overpowered by
numbers, captivated, and put to the most exquisite tortures of fire,
amidst a prodigious crowd of exulting foes.</p>
<p>One of the present Choktah traders, who was on the spot, told me
that when they were tied to the stake the younger of the two discovered
our traders on a hill near, addressed them in English, and entreated
them to redeem their lives. The elder immediately spoke to him, in his
own language, to desist. On this, he recollected himself, and became
composed like a stoic, manifesting an indifference to life or death,
pleasure or pain, according to their standard of martial virtue, and
their dying behaviour did not reflect the least dishonor on their
former gallant actions. All the pangs of fiery torture served only to
refine their manly spirits, and as it was out of the power of the
traders to redeem them they, according to our usual custom, retired as
soon as the Indians began the diabolical tragedy.&rdquo;&mdash;Adair,
American Indians, p. 383, 1775.</p>

<h4 class="main">92. ESCAPE OF THE SENECA BOYS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some Seneca warriors were hunting in the woods, and
one morning, on starting out for the day, they left two boys behind to
take care of the camp. Soon after they had gone, a war party of
Cherokee came up, and finding the boys alone took them both and started
back to the south, traveling at such a rate that when the hunters
returned in the evening they decided that it was of no use to follow
them. When the Cherokee reached their own country they gave the boys to
an old man, whose sons had been killed by the Seneca. He took the boys
and adopted them for his own, and they grew up with him until they were
large and strong enough to go hunting for themselves.</p>
<p>But all the time they remembered their own home, and one day the
older one said to his brother, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s kill the old man and
run away.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;we might get
lost if we ran away, we are so far from home.&rdquo; &ldquo;I remember
the way,&rdquo; said his brother, so they made a plan to escape. A few
days later the old man took the boys with him and the three set out
together for a hunt in the mountains. When they were well away from the
settlement the boys killed the old man, took all the meat and parched
corn meal they could easily carry, and started to make their way back
to the north, keeping away from the main trail and following the ridge
of the mountains. After many days they came to the end of the mountains
and found a trail which the older brother knew as the one along which
they had been taken when they were first captured. They went on bravely
now until they came to a wide clearing with houses at the farther end,
and the older brother said, &ldquo;I believe there is where we used to
live.&rdquo; It was so long ago that they were not quite sure, and
besides they were dressed now like Cherokee, so they thought it safer
to wait until dark. They saw a river ahead and went down to it and sat
behind a large tree to wait. Soon several women came down for water and
passed close to the tree without noticing the boys. Said the older
brother, &ldquo;I know those women. One of them is our mother.&rdquo;
They waited until the women had filled their buckets and started to the
village, when both ran out to meet them with the Seneca hailing-shout,
&ldquo;<i>Gowe&prime;! Gowe&prime;!</i>&rdquo; At first the women were
frightened and thought it a party of Cherokee, but when they heard
their own language they came nearer. Then the mother recognized her two
sons, and said, &ldquo;Let us go back and dance for the dead come to
life,&rdquo; and they were all very glad and went into the village
together.&mdash;Arranged from Curtin, Seneca manuscript.</p>

<h4 class="main">93. THE UNSEEN HELPERS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ganogwioeo&ntilde;, a war chief of the Seneca, led a
party against the Cherokee. When they came near the first town he left
his men outside <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360"
name="pb360">360</a>]</span>and went in alone. At the first house he
found an old woman and her granddaughter. They did not see him, and he
went into the &acirc;s&#301; and hid himself under some wood. When
darkness came on he heard the old woman say, &ldquo;Maybe
Ganogwioeo&ntilde; is near; I&rsquo;ll close the door.&rdquo; After a
while he heard them going to bed. When he thought they were asleep he
went into the house. The fire had burned down low, but the girl was
still awake and saw him. She was about to scream, when he said,
&ldquo;I am Ganogwioeo&ntilde;. If you scream I&rsquo;ll kill you. If
you keep quiet I&rsquo;ll not hurt you.&rdquo; They talked together,
and he told her that in the morning she must bring the chief&rsquo;s
daughter to him. She promised to do it, and told him where he should
wait. Just before daylight he left the house.</p>
<p>In the morning the girl went to the chief&rsquo;s house and said to
his daughter, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out together for wood.&rdquo; The
chief&rsquo;s daughter got ready and went with her, and when they came
to the place where Ganogwioeo&ntilde; was hiding he sprang out and
killed her, but did not hurt the other girl. He pulled off the scalp
and gave such a loud scalp yell that all the warriors in the town heard
it and came running out after him. He shook the scalp at them and then
turned and ran. He killed the first one that came up, but when he tried
to shoot the next one the bow broke and the Cherokee got him.</p>
<p>They tied him and carried him to the two women of the tribe who had
the power to decide what should be done with him. Each of these women
had two snakes tattooed on her lips, with their heads opposite each
other, in such a way that when she opened her mouth the two snakes
opened their mouths also. They decided to burn the soles of his feet
until they were blistered, then to put grains of corn under the skin
and to chase him with clubs until they had beaten him to death.</p>
<p>They stripped him and burnt his feet. Then they tied a bark rope
around his waist, with an old man to hold the other end, and made him
run between two lines of people, and with clubs in their hands. When
they gave the word to start Ganogwioeo&ntilde; pulled the rope away
from the old man and broke through the line and ran until he had left
them all out of sight. When night came he crawled into a hollow log. He
was naked and unarmed, with his feet in a pitiful condition, and
thought he could never get away.</p>
<p>He heard footsteps on the leaves outside and thought his enemies
were upon him. The footsteps came up to the log and some one said to
another, &ldquo;This is our friend.&rdquo; Then the stranger said to
Ganogwioeo&ntilde;, &ldquo;You think you are the same as dead; but it
is not so. We will take care of you. Stick out your feet.&rdquo; He put
out his feet from the log and felt something licking them. After a
while the voice said, &ldquo;I think we have licked his feet enough.
Now we must crawl inside the log and lie on each side of him to keep
him warm.&rdquo; They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href=
"#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>crawled in beside him. In the
morning they crawled out and told him to stick out his feet again. They
licked them again and then said to him, &ldquo;Now we have done all we
can do this time. Go on until you come to the place where you made a
bark shelter a long time ago, and under the bark you will find
something to help you.&rdquo; Ganogwioeo&ntilde; crawled out of the
log, but they were gone. His feet were better now and he could walk
comfortably. He went on until about noon, when he came to the bark
shelter, and under it he found a knife, an awl, and a flint, that his
men had hidden there two years before. He took them and started on
again.</p>
<p>Toward evening he looked around until he found another hollow tree
and crawled into it to sleep. At night he heard the footsteps and
voices again. When he put out his feet again, as the strangers told him
to do, they licked his feet as before and then crawled in and lay down
on each side of him to keep him warm. Still he could not see them. In
the morning after they went out they licked his feet again and said to
him, &ldquo;At noon you will find food.&rdquo; Then they went away.</p>
<p>Ganogwioeo&ntilde; crawled out of the tree and went on. At noon he
came to a burning log, and near it was a dead bear, which was still
warm, as if it had been killed only a short time before. He skinned the
bear and found it very fat. He cut up the meat and roasted as much as
he could eat or carry. While it was roasting he scraped the skin and
rubbed rotten wood dust on it to clean it until he was tired. When
night came he lay down to sleep. He heard the steps and the voices
again and one said, &ldquo;Well, our friend is lying down. He has
plenty to eat, and it does not seem as if he is going to die. Let us
lick his feet again.&rdquo; When they had finished they said to him,
&ldquo;You need not worry any more now. You will get home all
right.&rdquo; Before it was day they left him.</p>
<p>When morning came he put the bearskin around him like a shirt, with
the hair outside, and started on again, taking as much of the meat as
he could carry. That night his friends came to him again. They said,
&ldquo;Your feet are well, but you will be cold,&rdquo; so they lay
again on each side of him. Before daylight they left, saying,
&ldquo;About noon you will find something to wear.&rdquo; He went on
and about midday he came to two young bears just killed. He skinned
them and dressed the skins, then roasted as much meat as he wanted and
lay down to sleep. In the morning he made leggings of the skins, took
some of the meat, and started on.</p>
<p>His friends came again the next night and told him that in the
morning he would come upon something else to wear. As they said, about
noon he found two fawns just killed. He turned the skins and made
himself a pair of moccasins, then cut some of the meat, and traveled on
until evening, when he made a fire and had supper. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name="pb362">362</a>]</span></p>
<p>That night again he heard the steps and voices, and one said,
&ldquo;My friend, very soon now you will reach home safely and find
your friends all well. Now we will tell you why we have helped you.
Whenever you went hunting you always gave the best part of the meat to
us and kept only the smallest part for yourself. For that we are
thankful and help you. In the morning you will see us and know who we
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning when he woke up they were still there&mdash;two men
as he thought&mdash;but after he had said the last words to them and
started on, he turned again to look, and one was a white wolf and the
other a black wolf. That day he reached home.&mdash;Arranged from

<h4 class="main">94. HATCINO&Ntilde;DO&Ntilde;&rsquo;S ESCAPE FROM THE
CHEROKEE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hatcino&ntilde;do&ntilde; was a great warrior, the
greatest among the Seneca. Once he led a company against the Cherokee.
They traveled until they came to the great ridge on the border of the
Cherokee country, and then they knew their enemies were on the lookout
on the other side. Hatcino&ntilde;do&ntilde; told his men to halt where
they were while he went ahead to see what was in front. The enemy
discovered and chased him, and he ran into a canebrake, where the canes
were in two great patches with a narrow strip of open ground between.
They saw him go into the canes, so they set fire to the patch and
watched at the open place for him to come out, but before they got
around to it he had run across into the second patch and escaped. When
the canes had burned down the Cherokee looked for his body in the
ashes, but could not find any trace of it, so they went home.</p>
<p>When Hatcino&ntilde;do&ntilde; got into the second canebrake he was
tired out, so he lay down and fell asleep. At night while he was asleep
two men came and took him by the arm, saying: &ldquo;We have come for
you. Somebody has sent for you.&rdquo; They took him a long way, above
the sky vault, until they came to a house. Then they said: &ldquo;This
is where the man lives who sent for you.&rdquo; He looked, but could
see no door. Then a voice from the inside said &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo;
and something like a door opened of itself. He went in and there sat
Haw&#277;&ntilde;ni&prime;o, the Thunder-god.</p>
<p>Haw&#277;&ntilde;ni&prime;o said, &ldquo;I have sent for you and you
are here. Are you hungry?&rdquo; Hatcino&ntilde;do&ntilde; thought:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a strange way to talk; that&rsquo;s not the way I
do&mdash;I give food.&rdquo; The Thunder knew his thoughts, so he
laughed and said, &ldquo;I said that only in fun.&rdquo; He rose and
brought half a cake of bread, half of a wild apple, and half a pigeon.
Hatcino&ntilde;do&ntilde; said, &ldquo;This is very little to fill
me,&rdquo; but the Thunder replied, &ldquo;If you eat that, there is
more.&rdquo; He began eating, but, as he ate, everything became whole
again, so that he was not able to finish it.</p>
<p>While he was sitting he heard some one running outside, and directly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name=
"pb363">363</a>]</span>the door was thrown open and the Sun came in, so
bright that Hatcino&ntilde;do&ntilde; had to hold his head down. The
two beings talked together, but the Seneca could not understand a word,
and soon the visitor went out again. Then the Thunder said: &ldquo;That
is the one you call the Sun, who watches in the world below. It is
night down there now, and he is hurrying to the east. He says there has
just been a battle. I love both the Seneca and the Cherokee, and when
you get back to your warriors you must tell them to stop fighting and
go home.&rdquo; Again he brought food, half of each kind, and when
Hatcino&ntilde;do&ntilde; had eaten, the Thunder said, &ldquo;Now my
messengers will take you to your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened again of itself, and Hatcino&ntilde;do&ntilde;
followed the two Sky People until they brought him to the place where
he had slept, and there left him. He found his party and told the
warriors what he had seen. They held a council over it and decided to
strike the enemy once before going home. Hatcino&ntilde;do&ntilde; led
them. They met the Cherokee and went home with scalps.</p>
<p>He led another party against the Cherokee, but this time he was
taken and carried to the Cherokee town. It was the custom among the
Cherokee to let two women say what should be done with captives. They
decided that he should be tortured with fire, so he was tied to a tree,
and the wood was piled around him. Hatcino&ntilde;do&ntilde; gave
himself up for lost, when a rain storm came up and the people concluded
to wait until it was over. They went away and left him tied to the
tree.</p>
<p>Pretty soon an old woman came up to him, and said, &ldquo;My
grandson, you think you are going to die, but you are not. Try to stir
your limbs.&rdquo; He struggled and finally got his limbs free. Then
she said, &ldquo;Now you are free. I have come to repay your kindness.
You remember that you once found a frog in the middle of a circle of
fire and that you picked it up and put it into the water. I was that
frog, and now I help you. I sent the rain storm, and now you must go
down to the creek and follow the current.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the rain was over the people came back, but
Hatcino&ntilde;do&ntilde; was gone. They trailed him down to the creek,
but he had found a hollow tree lying in the water, with a hole on the
upper side through which he could breathe, so he crawled into it and
they could not find him. Once two of the Cherokee came and sat on the
log and he could hear them talking about him, but they did not know
that he was inside. When they were all gone, he came out and kept on
down the stream. After dark he came to a place where three hunters had
made a fire and gone to sleep for the night. Their hatchets and arms
were hung up on a tree. Hatcino&ntilde;do&ntilde; was naked. He
listened until he was sure the men were asleep, then he took one of
their hatchets and killed all three, one after another. He dressed
himself in the clothes of one, and put on his belt, with the knife and
hatchet. Then he washed himself at the creek and sat down by the fire
and cooked his supper. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href=
"#pb364" name="pb364">364</a>]</span>After that he stretched and
painted the three scalps and lay down by the fire to sleep. In the
morning he took what provision he could carry and traveled in a great
circle until he found the road by which he and his warriors had come.
He found fresh tracks and followed them until he saw smoke ahead. He
listened until he heard men speaking Seneca, and knew that it was his
party. Then he gave the Seneca
shout&mdash;<i>Gowe&prime;!</i>&mdash;three times and his friends ran
out to meet him. They had been afraid that he was killed, but were glad
now that they had waited for him. They went home together. This is
their story.&mdash;Arranged from Curtin, Seneca manuscript.</p>

<h4 class="main">95. HEMP-CARRIER</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the southern slope of the ridge, along the trail
from Robbinsville to Valley river, in Cherokee county, North Carolina,
are the remains of a number of stone cairns. The piles are leveled now,
but thirty years ago the stones were still heaped up into pyramids, to
which every Cherokee who passed added a stone. According to the
tradition these piles marked the graves of a number of women and
children of the tribe who were surprised and killed on the spot by a
raiding party of the Iroquois shortly before the final peace between
the two Nations. As soon as the news was brought to the settlements on
Hiwassee and Cheowa a party was made under <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e10462" title=
"Source: T&acirc;le&prime;tanigi&prime;sk&#301;">T&acirc;le&prime;danigi&prime;sk&#301;</span>,
&ldquo;Hemp-carrier,&rdquo; to follow and take vengeance on the enemy.
Among others of the party was the father of the noted chief
Tsunu&prime;l&#259;h&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;sk&#301;, or Junaluska, who
(Junaluska) died on Cheowa about 1855.</p>
<p>For days they followed the trail of the Iroquois across the Great
Smoky mountains, through forests and over rivers, until they finally
tracked them to their very town in the far northern Seneca country. On
the way they met another war party headed for the south, and the
Cherokee killed them all and took their scalps. When they came near the
Seneca town it was almost night, and they heard shouts in the
townhouse, where the women were dancing over the fresh Cherokee scalps.
The avengers hid themselves near the spring, and as the dancers came
down to drink the Cherokee silently killed one and another until they
had counted as many scalps as had been taken on Cheowa, and still the
dancers in the townhouse never thought that enemies were near. Then
said the Cherokee leader, &ldquo;We have covered the scalps of our
women and children. Shall we go home now like cowards, or shall we
raise the war whoop and let the Seneca know that we are men?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Let them come, if they will,&rdquo; said his men; and they
raised the scalp yell of the Cherokee. At once there was an answering
shout from the townhouse, and the dance came to a sudden stop. The
Seneca warriors swarmed out with ready gun and hatchet, but the nimble
Cherokee were off and away. There was a hot pursuit in the darkness,
but the Cherokee knew the trails and were light and active <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span>runners, and managed to get away with the loss
of only a single man. The rest got home safely, and the people were so
well pleased with Hemp-carrier&rsquo;s bravery and success that they
gave him seven wives.</p>

<h4 class="main">96. THE SENECA PEACEMAKERS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the course of the long war with the Cherokee it
happened once that eight Seneca determined to undertake a journey to
the south to see if they could make a peace with their enemies. On
coming near the border of the Cherokee country they met some hunters of
that tribe to whom they told their purpose. The latter at once hurried
ahead with the news, and when the peacemakers arrived they found
themselves well received by the Cherokee chiefs, who called a council
to consider the proposition. All but one of the chiefs favored the
peace, but he demanded that the eight delegates should first join them
in a war party which was just preparing to go against a tribe farther
south, probably the Creeks. The Seneca agreed, and set out with the war
party for the south; but in the fight which resulted, the Seneca
leader, The Owl, was captured. The other seven escaped with the
Cherokee.</p>
<p>A council was held in the enemy&rsquo;s camp, and it was decided
that The Owl should be burned at the stake. The wood was gathered and
everything made ready, but as they were about to tie him he claimed the
warrior&rsquo;s privilege to sing his death song and strike the post as
he recited his warlike deeds. The request pleased his enemies, who put
a tomahawk into his hands and told him to begin.</p>
<p>He told first his exploits in the north, and then in the west,
giving times and places and the number of scalps taken, until his
enemies were so pleased and interested that they forgot the prisoner in
the warrior. It was a long story, but at last he came to the battle in
which he was taken. He told how many relatives he had killed of the
very men around him, and then, striking the post with his tomahawk,
&ldquo;So many of your people have I killed, and so many will I yet
kill;&rdquo; and with that he struck down two men, sprang through the
circle of warriors, and was away. It was all so sudden that it was some
moments before his enemies could recover from their surprise. Then they
seized their weapons and were after him through the woods, but he had
had a good start and was running for his life, so that he outran the
chase and finally reached the Cherokee camp in safety and rejoined his
seven companions.</p>
<p>On this proof of good will the Cherokee then concluded the treaty,
and the peacemakers returned to their own country.&mdash;Arranged from

<h4 class="main">97. ORIGIN OF THE YONTO&Ntilde;WISAS DANCE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Two Seneca women who were sisters, with the baby boy
of the older one, were in a sugar grove near their home when a war
party of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>Cherokee came upon them and carried them off.
When the people of the town learned what had happened, they decided not
to go after the enemy for fear they would kill the women, so their made
no pursuit.</p>
<p>The Cherokee carried the women with them until they were within one
day of the Cherokee towns. The elder sister learned this and made up
her mind to try to escape. She had a knife without a handle hidden
under her belt, and that night when all lay down to sleep by the fire
she kept awake. When they were sleeping soundly, she looked around. She
and her sister were tied together, and on each side of them was a
Cherokee with the end of the rope under his body on the ground. Taking
out her knife, she cut the rope without waking the men, and then
rousing her sister quietly she whispered to her to come. They were
going to leave the little boy, but he started to cry, so she said,
&ldquo;Let us die together,&rdquo; and took him up on her back, and the
two women hurried away. In a little while they heard an alarm behind
them, and knew that their escape was discovered, and then they saw the
blazing pine knots waving through the trees where the Cherokee were
coming on looking for them. The women knew the Cherokee would hunt for
them toward the north, along the trail to the Seneca country, so they
made a circuit and went around to the south until they came in sight of
a fire and saw a man sitting by a tree, shaking a rattle and singing in
a low voice. They found they had come directly back to the
enemy&rsquo;s camp, so the older sister said, &ldquo;This will never
do; we must try again. Let us go straight ahead to that big tree in
front, and from that straight on to the next, and the next.&rdquo; In
this way they kept on a straight course until morning. When the sun
came up, they took another direction toward home, and at night they
rested in the woods.</p>
<p>They traveled all the next day, and at night rested again. In the
night a voice spoke to the younger woman, &ldquo;Is that where you are
resting?&rdquo; and she answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The voice said
again, &ldquo;Keep on, and you will come out at the spot where you were
captured. No harm will come to you. To-morrow you will find
food.&rdquo; She roused her sister and told her what the voice had
said.</p>
<p>In the morning they went on and at noon found a buck freshly killed.
Near by they found a log on fire, so they roasted some of the meat, had
a good meal, and carried away afterwards as much of the meat as they
could. They kept on, camping every night, and when the meat was nearly
gone they saved the rest for the little boy.</p>
<p>At last one night the voice spoke again to the younger sister and
said, &ldquo;You are on the right road, and to-morrow you will be on
the border of the Seneca country. You will find food. That is
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning she told her older sister. They started on again and
walked until about noon, when they came to a patch of wild potatoes.
They dug and found plenty, and as they looked around they saw smoke
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>where there had been a camp fire. They gathered
wood, made up the fire, and roasted the potatoes. Then they ate as many
as they wanted and carried the rest with them.</p>
<p>They traveled on until the potatoes were almost gone. Then at night
the voice came again to the younger woman, saying: &ldquo;At noon
tomorrow you will reach your home, and the first person you will meet
will be your uncle. When you get to the town, you must call the people
together and tell them all that has happened. You must go to the long
house and take off your skirt and carry it on your shoulder. Then you
must go inside and go around once, singing, &lsquo;We have come home;
we are here.&rsquo; This is the <i>Yonto&ntilde;wisas</i> song, and it
shall be for women only. Know now that we are the
<i>Hadionyageono&ntilde;</i>, the Sky People, who have watched over you
all this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the girl awoke, she told her sister, and they said, &ldquo;We
must do all this,&rdquo; and they began to sing as they went along.
About noon they heard the sound of chopping, and when they went to the
place they found it was their uncle cutting blocks to make spoons. He
did not see them until they spoke, and at first could hardly believe
that they were living women, because he knew that they had been taken
by the Cherokee. He was very glad to see them, and as they walked on to
the town they told him all they had been commanded to do by the Sky
People. When they arrived at the town, he called all the people
together, and they went to the long house. There the two women sang
their song and did everything exactly as they had been told to do, and
when it was over they said, &ldquo;This is all,&rdquo; and sat down.
This is the same Yonto&ntilde;wisas song that is still sung by the
women.&mdash;Arranged from Curtin, Seneca manuscript.</p>

<h4 class="main">98. GA&#700;NA&rsquo;S ADVENTURES AMONG THE
CHEROKEE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ga&#700;na&#700; was a Seneca war chief. He called a
council and said, &ldquo;We must go to the Cherokee and see if we
can&rsquo;t agree to be friendly together and live in peace
hereafter.&rdquo; The people consented, and the chief said, &ldquo;We
must go to water first before we start.&rdquo; So they went, a great
party of warriors, far away into the deep forest by the river side.
There were no women with them. For ten days they drank medicine every
morning to make them vomit and washed and bathed in the river each
day.</p>
<p>Then the chief said, &ldquo;Now we must get the eagle
feathers.&rdquo; They went to the top of a high hill and dug a trench
there the length of a man&rsquo;s body, and put a man into it, with
boughs over the top so that he could not be seen, and above that they
put the whole body of a deer. Then the people went off out of sight,
and said the words to invite Shada&#700;ge&prime;a, the great eagle
that lives in the clouds, to come down.</p>
<p>The man under the brushwood heard a noise, and a common eagle came
and ate a little and flew away again. Soon it came back, ate a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>little more, and flew off in another direction.
It told the other birds and they came, but the man scared them away,
because he did not want common birds to eat the meat. After a while he
heard a great noise coming through the air, and he knew it was
Shada&#700;ge&prime;a, the bird he wanted. Shada&#700;ge&prime;a is
very cautious, and looked around in every direction for some time
before be began to eat the meat. As soon as he was eating the man put
his hand up cautiously and caught hold of the bird&rsquo;s tail and
held on to it. Shada&#700;ge&prime;a rose up and flew away, and the man
had pulled out one feather. They had to trap a good many eagles in this
way, and it was two years before they could get enough feathers to make
a full tail, and were ready to start for the Cherokee country.</p>
<p>They were many days on the road, and when they got to the first
Cherokee town they found there was a stockade around it so that no
enemy could enter. They waited until the gate was open, and then two
Seneca dancers went forward, carrying the eagle feathers and shouting
the signal yell. When the Cherokee heard the noise they came out and
saw the two men singing and dancing, and the chief said, &ldquo;These
men must have come upon some errand.&rdquo; The Seneca messengers came
up and said, &ldquo;Call a council; we have come to talk on important
business.&rdquo; All turned and went toward the townhouse, the rest of
the Seneca following the two who were dancing. The townhouse was
crowded, and the Seneca sang and danced until they were tired before
they stopped. The Cherokee did not dance.</p>
<p>After the dance the Seneca chief said, &ldquo;Now I will tell you
why we have come so far through the forest to see you. We have thought
among ourselves that it is time to stop fighting. Your people and ours
are always on the lookout to kill each other, and we think it is time
for this to stop. Here is a belt of wampum to show that I speak the
truth. If your people are willing to be friendly, take it,&rdquo; and
he held up the belt. The Cherokee chief stepped forward and said,
&ldquo;I will hold it in my hand, and to-morrow we will tell you what
we decide.&rdquo; He then turned and said to the people, &ldquo;Go home
and bring food.&rdquo; They went and brought so much food that it made
a great pile across the house, and all of both tribes ate together, but
could not finish it.</p>
<p>Next day they ate together again, and when all were done the
Cherokee chief said to the Seneca, &ldquo;We have decided to be
friendly and to bury our weapons, these knives and hatchets, so that no
man may take them up again.&rdquo; The Seneca chief replied, &ldquo;We
are glad you have accepted our offer, and now we have all thrown our
weapons in a pile together, and the white wampum hangs between us, and
the belt shall be as long as a man and hang down to the
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Cherokee chief said to his people, &ldquo;Now is the time
for any of you that wishes to adopt a relative from among the Seneca to
do so.&rdquo; So some Cherokee women went and picked out one man and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span>said, &ldquo;You shall be our uncle,&rdquo; and
some more took another for their brother, and so on until only
Ga&#700;na&#700;, the chief, was left, but the Cherokee chief said,
&ldquo;No one must take Ga&#700;na&#700;, for a young man is here to
claim him as his father.&rdquo; Then the young man came up to
Ga&#700;na&#700; and said, &ldquo;Father, I am glad to see you. Father,
we will go home,&rdquo; and he led Ga&#700;na&#700; to his own
mother&rsquo;s house, the house where Ga&#700;na&#700; had spent the
first night. The young man was really his son, and when
Ga&#700;na&#700; came to the house he recognized the woman as his wife
who had been carried off long ago by the Cherokee.</p>
<p>While they were there a messenger came from the Seoqgwageono tribe,
that lived near the great salt water in the east, to challenge the
Cherokee to a ball play. He was dressed in skins which were so long
that they touched the ground. He said that his people were already on
the way and would arrive in a certain number of days. They came on the
appointed day and the next morning began to make the bets with the
Cherokee. The Seneca were still there. The strangers bet two very heavy
and costly robes, besides other things. They began to play, and the
Cherokee lost the game. Then the Seneca said, &ldquo;We will try this
time.&rdquo; Both sides bet heavily again, and the game began, but
after a little running the Seneca carried the ball to their goal and
made a point. Before long they made all the points and won the game.
Then the bets were doubled, and the Seneca won again. When they won a
third game also the Seoqgwageono said, &ldquo;Let us try a race,&rdquo;
and the Seneca agreed.</p>
<p>The course was level, and the open space was very wide. The Cherokee
selected the Seneca runner, and it was agreed that they would run the
first race without betting and then make their bets on the second race.
They ran the first race, and when they reached the post the Seneca
runner was just the measure of his body behind the other. His people
asked him if he had done his best, but he said, &ldquo;No; I have
not,&rdquo; so they made their bets, and the second race&mdash;the real
race&mdash;began. When they got to the middle the Seneca runner said to
the other, &ldquo;Do your best now, for I am going to do mine,&rdquo;
and as he said it he pulled out and left the other far behind and won
the race. Then the Seoqgwageono said, &ldquo;There is one more race
yet&mdash;the long race,&rdquo; and they got ready for it, but the
Cherokee chief said to his own men, &ldquo;We have won everything from
these people. I think it will be best to let them have one race, for if
they lose all, they may make trouble.&rdquo; They selected a Cherokee
to run, and he was beaten, and the Seoqgwageono went home.</p>
<p>In a few days they sent a messenger to challenge the Cherokee to
meet them halfway for a battle. When the Cherokee heard this they said
to the Seneca, &ldquo;There are so few of you here that we don&rsquo;t
want to have you killed. It is better for you to go home.&rdquo; So the

<p>Three years later they came again to visit the Cherokee, who told
them that the Seoqgwageono had won the battle, and that the chief of
the enemy had said afterward, &ldquo;I should like to fight the Seneca,
for I am a double man.&rdquo; Before long the enemy heard that the
Seneca were there and sent them a challenge to come and fight. The
Seneca said, &ldquo;We must try to satisfy them,&rdquo; so with
Cherokee guides they set out for the country of the Seoqgwageono. They
went on until they came to an opening in the woods within one
day&rsquo;s journey of the first village. Then they stopped and got
ready to send two messengers to notify the enemy, but the Cherokee
said, &ldquo;You must send them so as to arrive about sundown.&rdquo;
They did this, and when the messengers arrived near the town they saw
all the people out playing ball.</p>
<p>The two Seneca went around on the other side, and began throwing
sumac darts as they approached, so that the others would think they
were some of their own men at play. In this way they got near enough to
kill a man who was standing alone. They scalped him, and then raising
the scalp yell they rushed off through the woods, saying to each other
as they ran, &ldquo;Be strong&mdash;Be strong.&rdquo; Soon they saw the
Seoqgwageono coming on horses, but managed to reach a dry creek and to
hide under the bank, so that the enemy passed on without seeing
them.</p>
<p>The next morning they came out and started on, but the enemy was
still on the watch, and before long the two men saw the dust of the
horses behind them. The others came up until they were almost upon them
and began to shoot arrows at them, but by this time the two Seneca were
near the opening where their own friends were hiding, drawn up on each
side of the pass. As the pursuers dashed in the two lines of the Seneca
closed in and every man of the Seoqgwageono was either killed or
taken.</p>
<p>The Seneca went back to the Cherokee country and after about a month
they returned to their own homes. Afterward the Cherokee told them,
&ldquo;We hear the Seoqgwageono think you dangerous people. They
themselves are conjurers and can tell what other people are going to
do, but they cannot tell what the Seneca are going to do. The Seneca
medicine is stronger.&rdquo;&mdash;Arranged from Curtin, Seneca

<h4 class="main">99. THE SHAWANO WARS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among the most inveterate foes of the Cherokee were
the Shawano, known to the Cherokee as
Ani&prime;-Saw&#259;nu&prime;g&#301;, who in ancient times, probably as
early as 1680, removed from Savannah (i. e., Shawano) river, in South
Carolina, and occupied the Cumberland river region in middle Tennessee
and Kentucky, from which they were afterward driven by the superior
force of the southern tribes and compelled to take refuge north of the
Ohio. On all old maps we find the Cumberland <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name=
"pb371">371</a>]</span>marked as the &ldquo;river of the
Shawano.&rdquo; Although the two tribes were frequently, and perhaps
for long periods, on friendly terms, the ordinary condition was one of
chronic warfare, from an early traditional period until the close of
the Revolution. This hostile feeling was intensified by the fact that
the Shawano were usually the steady allies of the Creeks, the
hereditary southern enemies of the Cherokee. In 1749, however, we find
a party of Shawano from the north, accompanied by several Cherokee,
making an inroad into the Creek country, and afterward taking refuge
among the Cherokee, thus involving the latter in a new war with their
southern neighbors (Adair, Am. Inds., 276, 1775). The Shawano made
themselves respected for their fighting qualities, gaining a reputation
for valor which they maintained in their later wars with the whites,
while from their sudden attack and fertility of stratagem they came to
be regarded as a tribe of magicians. By capture or intermarriage in the
old days there is quite an admixture of Shawano blood among the
Cherokee.</p>
<p>According to Haywood, an aged Cherokee chief, named the Little
Cornplanter (Little Carpenter?), stated in 1772 that the Shawano had
removed from the Savannah river a long time before in consequence of a
disastrous war with several neighboring tribes, and had settled upon
the Cumberland, by permission of his people. A quarrel having afterward
arisen between the two tribes, a strong body of Cherokee invaded the
territory of the Shawano, and, treacherously attacking them, killed a
great number. The Shawano fortified themselves and a long war ensued,
which continued until the Chickasaw came to the aid of the Cherokee,
when the Shawano were gradually forced to withdraw north of the
Ohio.</p>
<p>At the time of their final expulsion, about the year 1710, the boy
Charleville was employed at a French post, established for the Shawano
trade, which occupied a mound on the south side of Cumberland river,
where now is the city of Nashville. For a long time the Shawano had
been so hard pressed by their enemies that they had been withdrawing to
the north in small parties for several years, until only a few remained
behind, and these also now determined to leave the country entirely. In
March the trader sent Charleville ahead with several loads of skins,
intending himself to follow with the Shawano a few months later. In the
meantime the Chickasaw, learning of the intended move, posted
themselves on both sides of Cumberland river, above the mouth of
Harpeth, with canoes to cut off escape by water, and suddenly attacked
the retreating Shawano, killing a large part of them, together with the
trader, and taking all their skins, trading goods, and other property.
Charleville lived to tell the story nearly seventy years later. As the
war was never terminated by any formal treaty of peace, the hostile
warriors continued to attack each other whenever they chanced to meet
on the rich hunting grounds of Kentucky, until finally, from mutual
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372</a>]</span>dread, the region was abandoned by both parties,
and continued thus unoccupied until its settlement by the
whites.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10560src" href="#xd25e10560" name=
"xd25e10560src">4</a></p>
<p>According to Cherokee tradition, a body of Creeks was already
established near the mouth of Hiwassee while the Cherokee still had
their main settlements upon the Little Tennessee. The Creeks, being
near neighbors, pretended friendship, while at the same time secretly
aiding the Shawano. Having discovered the treachery, the Cherokee took
advantage of the presence of the Creeks at a great dance at
Its&acirc;&prime;t&#301;, or Echota, the ancient Cherokee capital, to
fall suddenly upon them and kill nearly the whole party. The
consequence was a war, with the final result that the Creeks were
defeated and forced to abandon all their settlements on the waters of
the Tennessee river.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10565src" href=
"#xd25e10565" name="xd25e10565src">5</a></p>
<p>Haywood says that &ldquo;Little Cornplanter&rdquo; had seen Shawano
scalps brought into the Cherokee towns. When he was a boy, his father,
who was also a chief, had told him how he had once led a party against
the Shawano and was returning with several scalps, when, as they were
coming through a pass in the mountains, they ran into another party of
Cherokee warriors, who, mistaking them for enemies, fired into them and
killed several before they discovered their mistake.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e10570src" href="#xd25e10570" name="xd25e10570src">6</a></p>
<p>Schoolcraft also gives the Cherokee tradition of the war with the
Shawano, as obtained indirectly from white informants, but incorrectly
makes it occur while the latter tribe still lived upon the Savannah.
&ldquo;The Cherokees prevailed after a long and sanguinary contest and
drove the Shawnees north. This event they cherish as one of their
proudest achievements. &lsquo;What!&rsquo; said an aged Cherokee chief
to Mr Barnwell, who had suggested the final preservation of the race by
intermarriage with the whites. &lsquo;What! Shall the Cherokees perish!
Shall the conquerors of the Shawnees perish!
Never!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10575src" href=
"#xd25e10575" name="xd25e10575src">7</a></p>
<p>Tribal warfare as a rule consisted of a desultory succession of
petty raids, seldom approaching the dignity of a respectable skirmish
and hardly worthy of serious consideration except in the final result.
The traditions necessarily partake of the same trivial character, being
rather anecdotes than narratives of historical events which had dates
and names. Lapse of time renders them also constantly more vague.</p>
<p>On the Carolina side the Shawano approach was usually made up the
Pigeon river valley, so as to come upon the Cherokee settlements from
behind, and small parties were almost constantly lurking about waiting
the favorable opportunity to pick up a stray scalp. On one occasion
some Cherokee hunters were stretched around the camp fire at night when
they heard the cry of a flying squirrel in the woods&mdash;<i>tsu-u!
tsu-u! tsu-u!</i> Always on the alert for danger, they suspected it
might be the enemy&rsquo;s signal, and all but one hastily left the
fire and concealed themselves. That one, however, laughed at their
fears and, defiantly throwing some heavy logs on the fire, stretched
himself out on his blanket <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href=
"#pb373" name="pb373">373</a>]</span>and began to sing. Soon he heard a
stealthy step coming through the bushes and gradually approaching the
fire, until suddenly an enemy sprang out upon him from the darkness and
bore him to the earth. But the Cherokee was watchful, and putting up
his hands he seized the other by the arms, and with a mighty effort
threw him backward into the fire. The dazed Shawano lay there a moment
squirming upon the coals, then bounded to his feet and ran into the
woods, howling with pain. There was an answering laugh from his
comrades hidden in the bush, but although the Cherokee kept watch for
some time the enemy made no further attack, probably led by the very
boldness of the hunter to suspect some ambush.</p>
<p>On another occasion a small hunting party in the Smoky mountains
heard the gobble of a turkey (in telling the story Swimmer gives a good
imitation). Some eager young hunters were for going at once toward the
game, but others, more cautious, suspected a ruse and advised a
reconnaissance. Accordingly a hunter went around to the back of the
ridge, and on coming up from the other side found a man posted in a
large tree, making the gobble call to decoy the hunters within reach of
a Shawano war party concealed behind some bushes midway between the
tree and the camp. Keeping close to the ground, the Cherokee crept up
without being discovered until within gunshot, then springing to his
feet he shot the man in the tree, and shouting &ldquo;Kill them
all,&rdquo; rushed upon the enemy, who, thinking that a strong force of
Cherokee was upon them, fled down the mountain without attempting to
make a stand.</p>
<p>Another tradition of these wars is that concerning
Tun&acirc;&prime;&#301;, a great warrior and medicine-man of old
Its&acirc;&prime;t&#301;, on the Tennessee. In one hard fight with the
Shawano, near the town, he overpowered his man and stabbed him through
both arms. Running cords through the holes he tied his prisoner&rsquo;s
arms and brought him thus into Its&acirc;&prime;t&#301;, where he was
put to death by the women with such tortures that his courage broke and
he begged them to kill him at once.</p>
<p>After retiring to the upper Ohio the Shawano were received into the
protection of the Delawares and their allies, and being thus
strengthened felt encouraged to renew the war against the Cherokee with
increased vigor. The latter, however, proved themselves more than a
match for their enemies, pursuing them even to their towns in western
Pennsylvania, and accidentally killing there some Delawares who
occupied the country jointly with the Shawano. This involved the
Cherokee in a war with the powerful Delawares, which continued until
brought to an end in 1768 at the request of the Cherokee, who made
terms of friendship at the same time with the Iroquois. The Shawano
being thus left alone, and being, moreover, roundly condemned by their
friends, the Delawares, as the cause of the whole trouble, had no heart
to continue the war and were obliged to make final peace.<a class=

<h4 class="main">100. THE RAID ON T&#300;KW&#258;LI&prime;TS&#300;</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The last noted leader of the Shawano raiding parties
was a chief known to the Cherokee as
Tawa&prime;l&#301;-ukwan&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;t&#301;,
&ldquo;Punk-plugged-in,&rdquo; on account of a red spot on his cheek
which looked as though a piece of punk (<i>tawa&prime;l&#301;</i>) had
been driven into the flesh.</p>
<p>The people of T&#301;kw&#259;li&prime;ts&#301; town, on Tuckasegee,
heard rumors that a war party under this leader had come in from the
north and was lurking somewhere in the neighborhood. The Cherokee
conjurer, whose name was
&#276;t&#259;wa&prime;h&#259;-tsistatla&prime;sk&#301;,
&ldquo;Dead-wood-lighter,&rdquo; resorted to his magic arts and found
that the Shawano were in ambush along the trail on the north side of
the river a short distance above the town. By his advice a party was
fitted out to go up on the south side and come in upon the
enemy&rsquo;s rear. A few foolhardy fellows, however, despised his
words and boldly went up the trail on the north side until they came to
Deep Creek, where the Shawano in hiding at the ford took them
&ldquo;like fish in a trap&rdquo; and killed nearly all of them.</p>
<p>Their friends on the other side of the river heard the firing, and
crossing the river above Deep creek they came in behind the Shawano and
attacked them, killing a number and forcing the others to retreat
toward the Smoky mountains, with the Cherokee in pursuit. The invaders
had with them two Cherokee prisoners who were not able to keep up with
the rapid flight, so their captors took them, bound as they were, and
threw them over a cliff. An old conjurer of their own party finding
himself unable to keep up deliberately sat down against a tree near the
same spot to wait for death. The pursuers coming up split his head with
a hatchet and threw his body over the same cliff, which takes its name
from this circumstance. The Shawano continued to retreat, with the
Cherokee close behind them, until they crossed the main ridge at the
gap just below Clingman&rsquo;s dome. Here the Cherokee gave up the
pursuit and returned to their homes.</p>

<div class="div3 story" id="s101">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">101. THE LAST SHAWANO INVASION</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Perhaps a year after the raid upon
T&#301;kw&#259;li&prime;ts&#301;, the Shawano again, under the same
leader, came down upon the exposed settlement of Kanuga, on Pigeon
river, and carried off a woman and two children whom they found
gathering berries near the town. Without waiting to make an attack they
hastily retreated with their prisoners. The people of Kanuga sent for
aid to the other settlements farther south, and a strong party was
quickly raised to pursue the enemy and recover the captives. By this
time, however, the Shawano had had several days&rsquo; start and it was
necessary for the Cherokee to take a shorter course across the
mountains to overtake them. A noted conjurer named
K&acirc;&prime;lan&ucirc;, &ldquo;The Raven,&rdquo; of Hiwassee town,
was called upon to discover by his magic arts what direction the
Shawano had taken and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href=
"#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>how far they had already gone.
Calling the chiefs together he told them to fill the pipe and smoke and
he would return with the information before the pipe was smoked out.
They sat down in a circle around the fire and lighted the pipe, while
he went out into the woods. Soon they heard the cry of an owl, and
after some interval they heard it again, and the next moment the
conjurer walked out from the trees before yet the first smoke was
finished.</p>
<p>He reported that he had trailed the Shawano to their camp and that
they were seven days ahead. The Cherokee at once followed as The Raven
guided, and reached the place in seven days and found all the marks of
a camp, but the enemy was already gone. Again and once again the
conjurer went ahead in his own mysterious fashion to spy out the
country, and they followed as he pointed the way. On returning the
third time he reported that their enemies had halted beside the great
river (the Ohio), and soon afterward he came in with the news that they
were crossing it. The Cherokee hurried on to the river, but by this
time the Shawano were on the other side. The pursuers hunted up and
down until they found a favorable spot in the stream, and then waiting
until it was dark they prepared to cross, using logs as rafts and
tacking with the current, and managed it so well that they were over
long before daylight without alarming the enemy.</p>
<p>The trail was now fresh, and following it they soon came upon the
camp, which was asleep and all unguarded, the Shawano, thinking
themselves now safe in their own country, having neglected to post
sentinels. Rushing in with their knives and tomahawks, the Cherokee
fell upon their sleeping foe and killed a number of them before the
others could wake and seize their arms to defend themselves. Then there
was a short, desperate encounter, but the Shawano were taken at a
disadvantage, their leader himself being among the first killed, and in
a few moments they broke and ran, every man for himself, to escape as
best he could. The Cherokee released the captives, whom they found tied
to trees, and after taking the scalps from the dead Shawano, with their
guns and other equipments, returned to their own country.</p>

<h4 class="main">102. THE FALSE WARRIORS OF CHILHOWEE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some warriors of Chilhowee town, on Little Tennessee,
organized a war party, as they said, to go against the Shawano. They
started off north along the great war trail, but when they came to
Pigeon river they changed their course, and instead of going on toward
the Shawano country they went up the river and came in at the back of
Cowee, one of the Middle settlements of their own tribe. Here they
concealed themselves near the path until a party of three or four
unsuspecting townspeople came by, when they rushed out and killed them,
took their scalps and a gun belonging to a man named
G&ucirc;&ntilde;sk&#259;li&prime;sk&#301;, and then <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=
"pb376">376</a>]</span>hurriedly made their way home by the same
roundabout route to Chilhowee, where they showed the fresh scalps and
the gun, and told how they had met the Shawano in the north and
defeated them without losing a man.</p>
<p>According to custom, preparations were made at once for a great
scalp dance to celebrate the victory over the Shawano. The dance was
held in the townhouse and all the people of the settlement were there
and looked on, while the women danced with the scalps and the gun, and
the returned warriors boasted of their deeds. As it happened, among
those looking on was a visitor from Cowee, a gunstocker, who took
particular notice of the gun and knew it at once as one he had repaired
at home for G&ucirc;&ntilde;sk&#259;li&prime;sk&#301;. He said nothing,
but wondered much how it had come into possession of the Shawano.</p>
<p>The scalp dance ended, and according to custom a second dance was
appointed to be held seven days later, to give the other warriors also
a chance to boast of their own war deeds. The gunstocker, whose, name
was G&ucirc;lsadih&#301;&prime;, returned home to Cowee, and there
heard for the first time how a Shawano war party had surprised some of
the town people, killed several, and taken their scalps and a gun. He
understood it all then, and told the chief that the mischief had been
done, not by a hostile tribe, but by the false men of Chilhowee. It
seemed too much to believe, and the chief said it could not be
possible, until the gunstocker declared that he had recognized the gun
as one he had himself repaired for the man who had been killed. At last
they were convinced that his story was true, and all Cowee was eager
for revenge.</p>
<p>It was decided to send ten of their bravest warriors, under the
leadership of the gunstocker, to the next dance at Chilhowee, there to
take their own method of reprisal. Volunteers offered at once for the
service. They set out at the proper time and arrived at Chilhowee on
the night the dance was to begin. As they crossed the stream below the
town they met a woman coming for water and took their first revenge by
killing her. Men, women, and children were gathered in the townhouse,
but the Cowee men concealed themselves outside and waited.</p>
<p>In this dance it was customary for each warrior in turn to tell the
story of some deed against the enemy, putting his words into a song
which he first whispered to the drummer, who then sang with him,
drumming all the while. Usually it is serious business, but
occasionally, for a joke, a man will act the clown or sing of some
extravagant performance that is so clearly impossible that all the
people laugh. One man after another stepped into the ring and sang of
what he had done against the enemies of his tribe. At last one of the
late war party rose from his seat, and after a whisper to the drummer
began to sing of how they had gone to Cowee and taken scalps and the
gun, which he carried as he danced. The chief and the people, who knew
nothing of the treacherous act, laughed heartily at what they thought
was a great joke. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377"
name="pb377">377</a>]</span></p>
<p>But now the gunstocker, who had been waiting outside with the Cowee
men, stripped off his breechcloth and rushed naked into the townhouse.
Bending down to the drummer&mdash;who was one of the traitors, but
failed to recognize G&ucirc;lsadih&#301;&prime;&mdash;he gave him the
words, and then straightening up he began to sing, &ldquo;<i>Hi!</i>
Ask who has done this!&rdquo; while he danced around the circle, making
insulting gestures toward everyone there. The song was quick and the
drummer beat very fast.</p>
<p>He made one round and bent down again to the drummer, then
straightened up and sang, &ldquo;<i>Yu!</i> I have killed a pregnant
woman at the ford and thrown her body into the river!&rdquo; Several
men started with surprise, but the chief said, &ldquo;He is only
joking; go on with the dance,&rdquo; and the drummer beat rapidly.</p>
<p>Another round and he bent down again to the drummer and then began
to sing, &ldquo;We thought our enemies were from the north, but we have
followed them and they are here!&rdquo; Now the drummer knew at last
what it all meant and he drummed very slowly, and the people grew
uneasy. Then, without waiting on the drummer,
G&ucirc;lsadih&#301;&prime; sang, &ldquo;Cowee will have a ball play
with you!&rdquo;&mdash;and everyone knew this was a challenge to
battle&mdash;and then fiercely: &ldquo;But if you want to fight now my
men are ready to die here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he waved his hand and left the townhouse. The dancers
looked at each other uneasily and some of them rose to go. The chief,
who could not understand it, urged them to go on with the dance, but it
was of no avail. They left the townhouse, and as they went out they met
the Cowee men standing with their guns ready and their hatchets in
their belts. Neither party said anything, because they were still on
friendly ground, but everyone knew that trouble was ahead.</p>
<p>The Cowee men returned home and organized a strong party of warriors
from their own and all the neighboring Middle settlements to go and
take vengeance on Chilhowee and on Kuw&acirc;&prime;h&#301;, just
below, which had also been concerned in the raid. They went down the
Tennessee and crossed over the mountains, but when they came on the
other side they found that their enemies had abandoned their homes and
fled for refuge to the remoter settlements or to the hostile Shawano in
the north.</p>

<h4 class="main">103. COWEE TOWN</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cowee&prime;, properly Kawi&prime;y&#301;, abbreviated
Kawi&prime;, was the name of two Cherokee settlements, one of which
existed in 1755 on a branch of Keowee river, in upper South Carolina,
while the other and more important was on Little Tennessee river, at
the mouth of Cowee creek, about 10 miles below the present Franklin, in
North Carolina. It was destroyed by the Americans in 1876, when it
contained about a hundred houses, but was rebuilt and continued to be
occupied until the cession of 1819. The name can not be translated, but
may possibly mean &ldquo;the place of the Deer clan&rdquo;
(Ani&prime;-Kaw&#301;&prime;). It was one <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb378" href="#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>of the oldest and
largest of the Cherokee towns, and when Wafford visited it as a boy he
found the trail leading to it worn so deep in places that, although on
horseback, he could touch the ground with his feet on each side.</p>
<p>There is a story, told by Wafford as a fact, of a Shawano who had
been a prisoner there, but had escaped to his people in the north, and
after the peace between the two tribes wandered back into the
neighborhood on a hunting trip. While standing on a hill overlooking
the valley he saw several Cherokee on an opposite hill, and called out
to them, &ldquo;Do you still own Cowee?&rdquo; They shouted in reply,
&ldquo;Yes; we own it yet.&rdquo; Back came the answer from the
Shawano, who wanted to encourage them not to sell any more of their
lands, &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the best town of the Cherokee.
It&rsquo;s a good country; hold on to it.&rdquo;</p>

find the two tribes at war, for which their neighbors are held
responsible. According to the Delaware account, the Iroquois, in one of
their forays to the south, killed a Cherokee in the woods and purposely
left a Delaware war club near the body to make it appear that the work
had been done by men of that tribe. The Cherokee found the body and the

<p>Later there seems to have been peace until war was again brought on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>by the action of the Shawano, who had taken
refuge with the Delawares, after having been driven from their old home
on Cumberland river by the Cherokee. Feeling secure in their new
alliance, the Shawano renewed their raids upon the Cherokee, who
retaliated by pursuing them into the Delaware country, where they
killed several Delawares by mistake. This inflamed the latter people,
already excited by the sight of Cherokee scalps and prisoners brought
back through their country by the Iroquois, and another war was the
result, which lasted until the Cherokee, tired of fighting so many
enemies, voluntarily made overtures for peace in 1768, saluting the
Delawares as Grandfather, an honorary title accorded them by all the
Algonquian tribes. The Delawares then reprimanded the Shawano, as the
cause of the trouble, and advised them to keep quiet, which, as they
were now left to fight their battles alone, they were glad enough to
do. At the same time the Cherokee made peace with the Iroquois, and the
long war with the northern tribes came to an end. The friendly feeling
thus established was emphasized in 1779, when the Cherokee sent a
message of condolence upon the death of the Delaware chief
White-eyes.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10695src" href="#xd25e10695"

<p>The Tuscarora, formerly the ruling tribe of eastern North Carolina,
are still remembered under the name
Ani&prime;-Sk&#259;l&acirc;&prime;l&#301;, and are thus mentioned in
the Feather dance of the Cherokee, in which some of the actors are
supposed to be visiting strangers from other tribes.</p>
<p>As the majority of the Tuscarora fled from Carolina to the Iroquois
country about 1713, in consequence of their disastrous war with the
whites, their memory has nearly faded from the recollection of the
southern Indians. From the scanty light which history throws upon their
mutual relations, the two tribes seem to have been almost constantly at
war with each other. When at one time the Cherokee, having already made
peace with some other of their neighbors, were urged by the whites to
make peace also with the Tuscarora, they refused, on the ground that,
as they could not live without war, it was better to let matters stand
as they were than to make peace with the Tuscarora and be obliged
immediately to look about for new enemies with whom to fight. For some
years before the outbreak of the Tuscarora war in 1711 the Cherokee had
ceased their inroads upon this tribe, and it was therefore supposed
that they were more busily engaged with some other people west of the
mountains, these being probably the Shawano, whom they drove out of
Tennessee about this time.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10702src" href=
"#xd25e10702" name="xd25e10702src">13</a> In the war of 1711&ndash;1713
the Cherokee assisted the whites against the Tuscarora. In 1731 the
Cherokee again threatened to make war upon the remnant of that tribe
still residing in North Carolina and the colonial government was
compelled to interfere.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10705src" href=
"#xd25e10705" name="xd25e10705src">14</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb380" href="#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Cheraw or Sara, ranging at different periods from upper South
Carolina to the southern frontier of Virginia, are also remembered
under the name of Ani&prime;-Suwa&prime;l&#301;, or
Ani&prime;-Suwa&prime;la, which agrees with the Spanish form Xuala of
De Soto&rsquo;s chronicle, and Suala, or Sualy, of Lederer. The
Cherokee remember them as having lived east of the Blue ridge, the
trail to their country leading across the gap at the head of Swannanoa
river, east from Asheville. The name of the stream and gap is a
corruption of the Cherokee
Suwa&prime;l&#301;-N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&acirc;&prime;h&#301;,
&ldquo;Suwa&prime;li trail.&rdquo; Being a very warlike tribe, they
were finally so reduced by conflicts with the colonial governments and
the Iroquois that they were obliged to incorporate with the Catawba,
among whom they still maintained their distinct language as late as
1743.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10714src" href="#xd25e10714" name=
"xd25e10714src">15</a></p>
<p>The Catawba are known to the Cherokee as Ani&prime;ta&prime;gwa,
singular Ata&prime;gwa, or Ta&prime;gwa, the Cherokee attempt at the
name by which they are most commonly known. They were the immediate
neighbors of the Cherokee on the east and southeast, having their
principal settlements on the river of their name, just within the
limits of South Carolina, and holding the leading place among all the
tribes east of the Cherokee country with the exception of the
Tuscarora. On the first settlement of South Carolina there were
estimated to be about 7,000 persons in the tribe, but their decline was
rapid, and by war and disease their number had been reduced in 1775 to
barely 500, including the incorporated remnants of the Cheraw and
several smaller tribes. There are now, perhaps, 100 still remaining on
a small reservation near the site of their ancient towns. Some local
names in the old Cherokee territory seem to indicate the former
presence of Catawba, although there is no tradition of any Catawba
settlement within those limits. Among such names may be mentioned
Toccoa creek, in northeastern Georgia, and Toccoa river, in
north-central Georgia, both names being derived from the Cherokee
Tagw&acirc;&prime;h&#301;, &ldquo;Catawba place.&rdquo; An old Cherokee
personal name is Ta&prime;gw&#259;dih&#301;&prime;,
&ldquo;Catawba-killer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two tribes were hereditary enemies, and the feeling between them
is nearly as bitter to-day as it was a hundred years ago. Perhaps the
only case on record of their acting together was in the war of
1711&ndash;13, when they cooperated with the colonists against the
Tuscarora. The Cherokee, according to the late Colonel Thomas, claim to
have formerly occupied all the country about the head of the Catawba
river, to below the present Morganton, until the game became scarce,
when they retired to the west of the Blue ridge, and afterward
&ldquo;loaned&rdquo; the eastern territory to the Catawba. This agrees
pretty well with a Catawba tradition recorded in Schoolcraft, according
to which the Catawba&mdash;who are incorrectly represented as
comparatively recent immigrants from the north&mdash;on arriving at
Catawba river found <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381"
name="pb381">381</a>]</span>their progress disputed by the Cherokee,
who claimed original ownership of the country. A battle was fought,
with incredible loss on both sides, but with no decisive result,
although the advantage was with the Catawba, on account of their having
guns, while their opponents had only Indian weapons. Preparations were
under way to renew the fight when the Cherokee offered to recognize the
river as the boundary, allowing the Catawba to settle anywhere to the
east. The overture was accepted and an agreement was finally made by
which the Catawba were to occupy the country east of that river and the
Cherokee the country west of Broad river, with the region between the
two streams to remain as neutral territory. Stone piles were heaped up
on the battlefield to commemorate the treaty, and the Broad river was
henceforth called Eswau Huppeday (Line river), by the Catawba, the
country eastward to Catawba river being left unoccupied.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e10723src" href="#xd25e10723" name=
"xd25e10723src">16</a> The fact that one party had guns would bring
this event within the early historic period.</p>
<p>The Catawba assisted the whites against the Cherokee in the war of
1760 and in the later Revolutionary struggle. About 100 warriors,
nearly the whole fighting strength of the tribe, took part in the
first-mentioned war, several being killed, and a smaller number
accompanied Williamson&rsquo;s force in 1776.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10732src" href="#xd25e10732" name="xd25e10732src">17</a> At the
battle fought under Williamson near the present site of Franklin, North
Carolina, the Cherokee, according to the tradition related by Wafford,
mistook the Catawba allies of the troops for some of their own
warriors, and were fighting for some time under this impression before
they noticed that the Catawba wore deer tails in their hair so that the
whites might not make the same mistake. In this engagement, which was
one of the bloodiest Indian encounters of the Revolution, the Cherokee
claim that they had actually defeated the troops and their Catawba
allies, when their own ammunition gave out and they were consequently
forced to retire. The Cherokee leader was a noted war chief named
Tsan&#301; (John).</p>
<p>About 1840 nearly the whole Catawba tribe moved up from South
Carolina and joined the eastern band of Cherokee, but in consequence of
tribal jealousies they remained but a short time, and afterward
returned to their former home, as is related elsewhere.</p>
<p>Other tribal names (of doubtful authority) are
Ani&prime;-Sa&prime;n&#301; and Ani&prime;-Sawah&acirc;&prime;n&#301;,
belonging to people said to have lived toward the north; both names are
perhaps intended for the Shawano or Shawnee, properly
Ani&prime;-Saw&#259;nu&prime;g&#301;. The Ani&prime;-Gil&#301;&prime;
are said to have been neighbors of the Anin&prime;ts&#301; or Natchez;
the name may possibly be a Cherokee form for Congaree. <span class=

<h4 class="main">105. THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN TRIBES</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The nearest neighbors of the Cherokee to the south
were the Creeks or Muscogee, who found mixed confederacy holding
central and southern Georgia and Alabama. They were known to the
Cherokee as Ani&prime;-Ku&prime;sa or Ani&prime;-Gu&prime;sa. from
Kusa, the principal town of the Upper Creeks, which was situated on
Coosa river, southwest from the present Talladega, Alabama. The Lower
Creeks, residing chiefly on Chattahoochee river, were formerly always
distinguished as Ani-Kawi&prime;ta, from Kawita or Coweta, their
ancient capital, on the west side of the river, in Alabama, nearly
opposite the present Columbus, Georgia. In number the Creeks were
nearly equal to the Cherokee, but differed in being a confederacy of
cognate or incorporated tribes, of which the Muscogee proper was the
principal. The Cherokee were called by them Tsal-gal&prime;gi or
Ts&ucirc;lg&ucirc;l&prime;gi, a plural derivative from
Tsa&prime;l&#259;g&#301;&prime;, the proper name of the tribe.</p>
<p>The ordinary condition between the two tribes was one of hostility,
with occasional intervals of good will. History, tradition, and
linguistic evidence combine to show that the Creeks at one time
occupied almost the whole of northern Georgia and Alabama, extending a
considerable distance into Tennessee and perhaps North Carolina, and
were dispossessed by the Cherokee pressing upon them from the north and
northeast. This conquest was accomplished chiefly during the first half
of the eighteenth century, and culminated with the decisive engagement
of Tali&prime;w&#259; about 1755. In most of their early negotiations
with the Government the Creeks demanded that the lands of the various
tribes be regarded as common property, and that only the boundary
between the Indians and the whites be considered. Failing in that, they
claimed as theirs the whole region of the Chattahoochee and Coosa,
north to the dividing ridge between those streams and the Tennessee, or
even beyond to the Tennessee itself, and asserted that any Cherokee
settlements within those limits were only by their own permission. In
1783 they claimed the Savannah river as the eastern boundary between
themselves and the Cherokee, and asserted their own exclusive right of
sale over all the territory between that river and the Oconee. On the
other hand the Cherokee as stoutly claimed all to a point some 70 miles
south of the present city of Atlanta, on the ground of having driven
the Creeks out of it in three successive wars, and asserted that their
right had been admitted by the Creeks themselves in a council held to
decide the question between the two tribes before the Revolution. By
mutual agreement, about 1816, members of either tribe were allowed to
settle within the territory claimed by the other. The line as finally
established through the mediation of the colonial and Federal
governments ran from the mouth of Broad river on Savannah nearly due
west across Georgia, passing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href=
"#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>about 10 miles north of Atlanta,
to Coosa river in Alabama, and thence northwest to strike the west line
of Alabama about 20 miles south of the Tennessee.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10749src" href="#xd25e10749" name="xd25e10749src">18</a></p>
<p>Among the names which remain to show the former presence of Creeks
north of this boundary are the following: Coweeta, a small creek
entering the Little Tennessee above Franklin. North Carolina; Tomatola
(Cherokee. Tama&prime;&#699;l&#301;), a former town site on Valley
river, near Murphy, North Carolina, the name being that of a former
Creek town on Chattahoochee: Tomotley (Cherokee,
Tama&prime;&#699;l&#301;), a ford at another town site on Little
Tennessee, above Tellico mouth, in Tennessee: Coosa (Cherokee,
Kus&#259;&prime;), an upper creek of Nottely river, in Union county,
Georgia: Chattooga (Cherokee, Tsatu&prime;g&#301;), a river in
northwest Georgia: Chattooga (Cherokee, Tsatu&prime;g&#301;), another
river, a head-stream of Savannah: Chattahoochee river (Creek,
Chatu-huchi, &ldquo;pictured rocks&rdquo;); Coosawatee (Cherokee,
Ku&prime;s&#259;-weti&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Old Creek place&rdquo;), a
river in northwestern Georgia; Tali&prime;w&#259;, the Cherokee form of
a Creek name for a place on an upper branch of Etowah river in Georgia,
probably from the Creek <i>ta&prime;lua</i> or <i>ita&prime;lua,</i>
&ldquo;town&rdquo;; Euharlee (Cherokee, Yuha&prime;l&#301;, said by the
Cherokee to be from Yufala or Eufaula, the name of several Creek
towns), a creek flowing into lower Etowah river; Suwanee (Cherokee,
Suwa&#699;n&#301;) a small creek on upper Chattahoochee, the site of a
former Cherokee town with a name which the Cherokee say is Creek.
Several other names within the same territory are said by the Cherokee
to be of foreign origin, although perhaps not Creek, and may be from
the Taskigi language.</p>
<p>According to Cherokee tradition as given to Haywood nearly eighty
years ago the country about the mouth of Hiwassee river, in Tennessee,
was held by the Creeks, while the Cherokee still had their main
settlements farther to the north, on the Little Tennessee. In the
Shawano war, about the year 1700, the Creeks pretended friendship for
the Cherokee while secretly helping their enemies, the Shawano. The
Cherokee discovered the treachery, and took occasion, when a party of
Creeks was visiting a dance at Its&acirc;&prime;t&#301; (Echota), the
Cherokee capital, to fall upon them and massacre nearly every man. The
consequence was a war between the two tribes, with the final result
that the Creeks were forced to abandon all their settlements upon the
waters of the Tennessee, and to withdraw south to the Coosa and the
neighborhood of the &ldquo;Creek path,&rdquo; an old trading trail from
South Carolina, which crossed at the junction of the Oostanaula and
Etowah rivers, where now is the city of Rome, Georgia, and struck the
Tennessee at the present Guntersville, Alabama.</p>
<p>As an incident of this war the same tradition relates how the
Cherokee once approached a large Creek settlement &ldquo;at the island
on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name=
"pb384">384</a>]</span>the Creek path,&rdquo; in Tennessee river,
opposite Guntersville, and, concealing their main force, sent a small
party ahead to decoy the Creeks to an engagement. The Creek warriors at
once crossed over in their canoes to the attack, when the Cherokee
suddenly rose up from their ambush, and surrounded the Creeks and
defeated them after a desperate battle. Then, taking the captured
canoes, they went over to the island and destroyed all that was there.
The great leader of the Cherokee in this war was a chief named
Bullhead, renowned in tradition for his bravery and skill in
strategy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10766src" href="#xd25e10766" name=
"xd25e10766src">19</a> At about the same time, according to Wafford,
the Cherokee claim to have driven the Creeks and Shawano from a
settlement which they occupied jointly near Savannah, Georgia.</p>
<p>There was a tradition among the few old traders still living in
upper Georgia in 1890 that a large tract in that part of the State had
been won by the Cherokee from the Creeks in a ballplay.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e10771src" href="#xd25e10771" name=
"xd25e10771src">20</a> There are no Indians now living in that region
to substantiate the story. As originally told it may have had a veiled
meaning, as among the Cherokee the expression &ldquo;to play a ball
game&rdquo; is frequently used figuratively to denote fighting a
battle. There seems to be no good ground for Bartram&rsquo;s statement
that the Cherokee had been dispossessed by the Creeks of the region
between the Savannah and the Ocmulgee, in southwestern Georgia, within
the historic period.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10777src" href=
"#xd25e10777" name="xd25e10777src">21</a> The territory is south of any
traditional Cherokee claim, and the statement is at variance with what
we know through history. He probably had in mind the Uchee, who did
actually occupy that country until incorporated with the Creeks.</p>
<p>The victory was not always on one side, however, for Adair states
that toward the end of the last war between the two tribes the Creeks,
having easily defeated the Cherokee in an engagement, contemptuously
sent against them a number of women and boys. According to this writer,
the &ldquo;true and sole cause&rdquo; of this last war was the killing
of some adopted relatives of the Creeks in 1749 by a party of northern
Shawano, who had been guided and afterward sheltered by the Cherokee.
The war, which he represents as a losing game for the Cherokee, was
finally brought to an end through the efforts of the governor of South
Carolina, with the unfortunate result to the English that the Creeks
encouraged the Cherokee in the war of 1760 and rendered them very
essential help in the way of men and ammunition.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10782src" href="#xd25e10782" name="xd25e10782src">22</a></p>
<p>The battle of Tali&prime;w&#259;, which decided in favor of the
Cherokee the long war between themselves and the Creeks, was fought
about 1755 or a few years later at a spot on Mountain creek or
Long-swamp creek, which enters Etowah river above Canton, Georgia, near
where <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=
"pb385">385</a>]</span>the old trail crossed the river about Long-swamp
town. All our information concerning it is traditional, obtained from
James Wafford, who heard the story when a boy, about the year 1815,
from an old trader named Brian Ward, who had witnessed the battle sixty
years before. According to his account, it was probably the hardest
battle ever fought between the two tribes, about five hundred Cherokee
and twice that number of Creek warriors being engaged. The Cherokee
were at first overmatched and fell back, but rallied again and returned
to the attack, driving the Creeks from cover so that they broke and
ran. The victory was complete and decisive, and the defeated tribe
immediately afterward abandoned the whole upper portion of Georgia and
the adjacent part of Alabama to the conquerors. Before this battle the
Creeks had been accustomed to shift about a good deal from place to
place, but thereafter they confined themselves more closely to fixed
home locations. It was in consequence of this defeat that they
abandoned their town on Nottely river, below Coosa creek, near the
present Blairsville, Georgia, their old fields being at once occupied
by Cherokee, who moved over from their settlements on the head of
Savannah river. As has been already stated, a peace was made about
1759, just in time to enable the Creeks to assist the Cherokee in their
war with South Carolina. We hear little more concerning the relations
of the two tribes until the Creek war of 1813&ndash;14, described in
detail elsewhere; after this their histories drift apart.</p>
<p>The Yuchi or Uchee, called Ani&prime;-Yu&prime;ts&#301; by the
Cherokee, were a tribe of distinct linguistic stock and of considerable
importance in early days; their territory bordered Savannah river on
both sides immediately below the Cherokee country, and extended some
distance westward into Georgia, where it adjoined that of the Creeks.
They were gradually dispossessed by the whites, and were incorporated
with the Creeks about the year 1740, but retain their separate identity
and language to this day, their town being now the largest in the Creek
Nation in Indian Territory.</p>
<p>According to the testimony of a Cherokee mixed-blood named
Gans&#277;&prime;&#699;t&#301; or Rattling-gourd, who was born on
Hiwassee river in 1820 and came west with his people in 1838, a number
of Yuchi lived, before the Removal, scattered among the Cherokee near
the present Cleveland, Tennessee, and on Chickamauga, Cohutta, and
Pinelog creeks in the adjacent section of Georgia. They had no separate
settlements, but spoke their own language, which he described as
&ldquo;hard and grunting.&rdquo; Some of them spoke also Cherokee and
Creek. They had probably drifted north from the Creek country before a
boundary had been fixed between the tribes. When Tahlequah was
established as the capital of the Cherokee Nation in the West in 1839 a
few Yuchi were found already settled at the spot, being supposed to
have removed from the East with some Creeks after the chief McIntosh
was killed in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name=
"pb386">386</a>]</span>1825. They perished in the smallpox epidemic
which ravaged the frontier in 1840, and their graves were still pointed
out at Tahlequah in 1891. Shortly before the outbreak of the Civil war
there was a large and prosperous Yuchi settlement on Cimarron river, in
what was afterward the Cherokee strip.</p>
<p>Ramsey states that &ldquo;a small tribe of Uchees&rdquo; once
occupied the country near the mouth of the Hiwassee, and was nearly
exterminated in a desperate battle with the Cherokee at the Uchee Old
Fields, in Rhea (now Meigs) county, Tennessee, the few survivors
retreating to Florida, where they joined the Seminoles.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e10798src" href="#xd25e10798" name=
"xd25e10798src">23</a> There seems to be no other authority for the
statement.</p>
<p>Another broken tribe incorporated in part with the Creeks and in
part with the Cherokee was that of the Na&prime;&#699;ts&#301;, or
Natchez, who originally occupied the territory around the site of the
present town of Natchez in southern Mississippi, and exercised a
leading influence over all the tribes of the region. In consequence of
a disastrous war with the French in 1729&ndash;31 the tribe was
disrupted, some taking refuge with the Chickasaw, others with the
Creeks, either then or later, while others, in 1736, applied to the
government of South Carolina for permission to settle on the Savannah
river. The request was evidently granted, and we find the
&ldquo;Nachee&rdquo; mentioned as one of the tribes living with the
Catawba in 1743, but retaining their distinct language. In consequence
of having killed some of the Catawba in a drunken quarrel they were
forced to leave this region, and seem to have soon afterward joined the
Cherokee, as we find them twice mentioned in connection with that tribe
in 1755. This appears to be the last reference to them in the South
Carolina records.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10803src" href=
"#xd25e10803" name="xd25e10803src">24</a></p>
<p>Just here the Cherokee tradition takes them up, under the name of
Anin&prime;ts&#301;, abbreviated from
Ani&prime;-Na&prime;&#699;ts&#301;, the plural of
Na&prime;&#699;ts&#301;. From a chance coincidence with the word for
pine tree, <i>na&#699;ts&#301;&prime;</i>, some English speaking
Indians have rendered this name as &ldquo;Pine Indians.&rdquo; The
Cherokee generally agree that the Natchez came to them from South
Carolina, though some say that they came from the Creek country. It is
probable that the first refugees were from Carolina and were joined
later by others from the Creeks and the Chickasaw. Bienville states, in
1742, that some of them had gone to the Cherokee directly from the
Chickasaw when they found the latter too hard pressed by the French to
be able to care for them.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10811src" href=
"#xd25e10811" name="xd25e10811src">25</a> They seem to have been
regarded by the Cherokee as a race of wizards and conjurers, a view
which was probably due in part to their peculiar religious rites and in
part to the interest which belonged to them as the remnant of an
extirpated tribe. Although we have no direct knowledge on the subject,
there is every <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387</a>]</span>reason to suppose that the two tribes had had
communication with each other long before the period of the Natchez
war.</p>
<p>According to the statement of James Wafford, who was born in 1806
near the site of Clarkesville, Ga., when this region was still Indian
country, the &ldquo;Notchees&rdquo; had their town on the north bank of
Hiwassee, just above Peachtree creek, on the spot where a Baptist
mission was established by the Rev. Evan Jones in 1821, a few miles
above the present Murphy, Cherokee county, North Carolina. On his
mother&rsquo;s side he had himself a strain of Natchez blood. His
grandmother had told him that when she was a young woman, perhaps about
1755, she once had occasion to go to this town on some business, which
she was obliged to transact through an interpreter, as the Natchez had
been there so short a time that only one or two spoke any Cherokee.
They were all in the one town, which the Cherokee called
Gwal&#699;g&acirc;&prime;h&#301;, &ldquo;Frog place,&rdquo; but he was
unable to say whether or not it had a townhouse. In 1824, as one of the
census takers for the Cherokee Nation, he went over the same section
and found the Natchez then living jointly with the Cherokee in a town
called G&ucirc;&#699;l&#259;ni&prime;y&#301; at the junction of
Brasstown and Gumlog creeks, tributary to Hiwassee, some 6 miles
southeast of their former location and close to the Georgia line. The
removal may have been due to the recent establishment of the mission at
the old place. It was a large settlement, made up about equally from
the two tribes, but by this time the Natchez were not distinguishable
in dress or general appearance from the others, and nearly all spoke
broken Cherokee, while still retaining their own language. As most of
the Indians had come under Christian influences so far as to have quit
dancing, there was no townhouse. Harry Smith, who was born about 1820,
father of the late chief of the East Cherokee, also remembers them as
living on Hiwassee and calling themselves Na&prime;&#699;ts&#301;.</p>
<p>Gans&#277;&prime;&#699;t&#301;, already mentioned, states that when
he was a boy the Natchez were scattered among the Cherokee settlements
along the upper part of Hiwassee, extending down into Tennessee. They
had then no separate townhouses. Some of them, at least, had come up
from the Creeks, and spoke Creek and Cherokee, as well as their own
language, which he could not understand, although familiar with both of
the others. They were great dance leaders, which agrees with their
traditional reputation for ceremonial and secret knowledge. They went
west with the Cherokee at the final removal of the tribe to Indian
Territory in 1838. In 1890 there was a small settlement on Illinois
river a few miles south of Tahlequah, Cherokee Nation, several persons
in which still spoke their own language. Some of these may have come
with the Creeks, as by an agreement between Creeks and Cherokee about
the time of the Removal it had been arranged that citizens of either
tribe living within the boundaries claimed by the other might remain
without question if they so elected. There are still several
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>persons claiming Natchez descent among the East
Cherokee, but the last one said to have been of full Natchez blood, an
old woman named Alk&#301;n&#301;&prime;, died about 1895. She was noted
for her peculiarities, especially for a drawling tone, said to have
been characteristic of her people, as old men remembered them years
ago.</p>
<p>Haywood, the historian of Tennessee, says that a remnant of the
Natchez lived within the present limits of the State as late as 1750,
and were even then numerous. He refers to those with the Cherokee, and
tells a curious story, which seems somehow to have escaped the notice
of other writers. According to his statement, a portion of the Natchez,
who had been parceled out as slaves among the French in the vicinity of
their old homes after the downfall of their tribe, took advantage of
the withdrawal of the troops to the north, in 1758, to rise and
massacre their masters and make their escape to the neighboring tribes.
On the return of the troops after the fall of Fort Du Quesne they found
the settlement at Natchez destroyed and their Indian slaves fled. Some
time afterward a French deserter seeking an asylum among the Cherokee,
having made his way to the Great Island town, on the Tennessee, just
below the mouth of Tellico river, was surprised to find there some of
the same Natchez whom he had formerly driven as slaves. He lost no time
in getting away from the place to find safer quarters among the
mountain towns. Notchy creek, a lower affluent of Tellico, in Monroe
county, Tennessee, probably takes its name from these refugees. Haywood
states also that, although incorporated with the Cherokee, they
continued for a long time a separate people, not marrying or mixing
with other tribes, and having their own chiefs and holding their own
councils; but in 1823 hardly anything was left of them but the
name.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10824src" href="#xd25e10824" name=
"xd25e10824src">26</a></p>
<p>Another refugee tribe incorporated partly with the Cherokee and
partly with the Creeks was that of the Taskigi, who at an early period
had a large town of the same name on the south side of the Little
Tennessee, just above the mouth of Tellico, in Monroe county,
Tennessee. Sequoya, the inventor of the Cherokee alphabet, lived here
in his boyhood, about the time of the Revolution. The land was sold in
1819. There was another settlement of the name, and perhaps once
occupied by the same people, on the north bank of Tennessee river, in a
bend just below Chattanooga, Tennessee, on land sold also in 1819.
Still another may have existed at one time on Tuskegee creek, on the
south bank of Little Tennessee river, north of Robbinsville, in Graham
county, North Carolina, on land which was occupied until the Removal in
1838. Taskigi town of the Creek country was on Coosa river, near the
junction with the Tallapoosa, some distance above the present
Montgomery, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name=
"pb389">389</a>]</span>Alabama. We find Tasquiqui mentioned as a town
in the Creek country visited by the Spanish captain, Juan Pardo, in
1567. The name is evidently the same, though we can not be sure that
the location was identical with that of the later town.</p>
<p>Who or what the Taskigi were is uncertain and can probably never be
known, but they were neither Cherokee nor Muscogee proper. It would
seem most probable that they were of Muskhogean affinity, but they may
have been an immigrant tribe from another section, or may even have
constituted a distinct linguistic stock, representing all that was left
of an ancient people whose occupation of the country antedated the
coming of the Cherokee and the Creeks. The name may be derived from
<i>taska</i> or <i>tasha&prime;ya</i>, meaning &ldquo;warrior&rdquo; in
several of the Muskhogean dialects. It is not a Cherokee word, and
Cherokee informants state positively that the Taskigi were a foreign
people, with distinct language and customs. They were not Creeks,
Natchez, Uchee, or Shawano, with all of whom the Cherokee were well
acquainted under other names. In the townhouse of their settlement at
the mouth of Tellico they had an upright pole, from the top of which
hung their protecting &ldquo;medicine,&rdquo; the image of a human
figure cut from a cedar log. For this reason the Cherokee in derision
sometimes called the place
Ats&#301;n&#259;&prime;-k&#699;ta&ucirc;&ntilde;, &ldquo;Hanging-cedar
place.&rdquo; Before the sale of the land in 1819 they were so nearly
extinct that the Cherokee had moved in and occupied the ground.</p>
<p>Adair, in 1775, mentions the Tae-keo-ge (<i>sic</i>&mdash;a double
misprint) as one of several broken tribes which the Creeks had
&ldquo;artfully decoyed&rdquo; to incorporate with them in order to
strengthen themselves against hostile attempts. Milfort, about 1780,
states that the Taskigi on Coosa river were a foreign people who had
been driven by wars to seek an asylum among the Creeks, being
encouraged thereto by the kind reception accorded to another fugitive
tribe. Their request was granted by the confederacy, and they were
given lands upon which they built their town. He puts this event
shortly before the incorporation of the Yuchi, which would make it
early in the eighteenth century. In 1799, according to Hawkins, the
town had but 35 warriors, &ldquo;had lost its ancient language,&rdquo;
and spoke Creek. There is still a &ldquo;white&rdquo; or peace town
named Taskigi in the Creek Nation in Indian Territory.<a class=

<p>The nearest neighbors of the Cherokee on the west, after the
expulsion of the Shawano, were the Chickasaw, known to the Cherokee as
Ani&prime;-Ts&#301;&prime;ks&ucirc;, whose territory lay chiefly
between the Mississippi and the Tennessee, in what is now western
Kentucky and Tennessee and the extreme northern portion of Mississippi.
By virtue, however, of conquest from the Shawano or of ancient
occupancy they claimed a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href=
"#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>large additional territory to the
east of this, including all upon the waters of Duck river and Elk
creek. This claim was disputed by the Cherokee. According to Haywood,
the two tribes had been friends and allies in the expulsion of the
Shawano, but afterward, shortly before the year 1769, the Cherokee,
apparently for no sufficient reason, picked a quarrel with the
Chickasaw and attacked them in their town at the place afterward known
as the Chickasaw Old Fields, on the north side of Tennessee river, some
twenty miles below the present Guntersville, Alabama. The Chickasaw
defended themselves so well that the assailants were signally defeated
and compelled to retreat to their own country.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10854src" href="#xd25e10854" name="xd25e10854src">28</a> It
appears, however, that the Chickasaw, deeming this settlement too
remote from their principal towns, abandoned it after the battle.
Although peace was afterward made between the two tribes their rival
claim continued to be a subject of dispute throughout the treaty
period.</p>
<p>The Choctaw, a loose confederacy of tribes formerly occupying
southern Mississippi and the adjacent coast region, are called
Ani&prime;-Tsa&prime;&#699;ta by the Cherokee, who appear to have had
but little communication with them, probably because the intermediate
territory was held by the Creeks, who were generally at war with one or
the other. In 1708 we find mention of a powerful expedition by the
Cherokee, Creeks, and Catawba against the Choctaw living about Mobile
bay.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10859src" href="#xd25e10859" name=
"xd25e10859src">29</a></p>
<p>Of the Indians west of the Mississippi those best known to the
Cherokee were the Ani&prime;-Wasa&prime;s&#301;, or Osage, a powerful
predatory tribe formerly holding most of the country between the
Missouri and Arkansas rivers, and extending from the Mississippi far
out into the plains. The Cherokee name is a derivative from
Wasash&prime;, the name by which the Osage call themselves.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e10868src" href="#xd25e10868" name=
"xd25e10868src">30</a> The relations of the two tribes seem to have
been almost constantly hostile from the time when the Osage refused to
join in the general Indian peace concluded in 1768 (see &ldquo;The
Iroquois Wars&rdquo;) up to 1822, when the Government interfered to
compel an end of the bloodshed. The bitterness was largely due to the
fact that ever since the first Cherokee treaty with the United States,
made at Hopewell, South Carolina, in 1785, small bodies of Cherokee,
resenting the constant encroachments of the whites, had been removing
beyond the Mississippi to form new settlements within the territory
claimed by the Osage, where in 1817 they already numbered between two
and three thousand persons. As showing how new is our growth as a
nation, it is interesting to note that Wafford, when a boy, attended
near the site of the present Clarkesville, Georgia, almost on Savannah
river, a Cherokee scalp dance, at which the women <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span>danced over some Osage scalps sent by their
relatives in the west as trophies of a recent victory.</p>
<p>Other old Cherokee names for western tribes which can not be
identified are Tay&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;ks&#301;, the untranslatable
name of a tribe described simply as living in the West;
Tsuniya&prime;tig&#259;, &ldquo;Naked people,&rdquo; described as
living in the far West; G&ucirc;n&prime;-tsuskwa&prime;&#699;l&#301;,
&ldquo;Short-arrows,&rdquo; who lived in the far West, and were small,
but great fighters; Y&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;wini&prime;gisk&#301;,
&ldquo;Man-eaters,&rdquo; a hostile tribe west or north, possibly the
cannibal Atakapa or Tonkawa, of Louisiana or Texas. Their relations
with the tribes with which they have become acquainted since the
removal to Indian Territory do not come within the scope of this

<h4 class="main">106. THE GIANTS FROM THE WEST</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">James Wafford, of the western Cherokee, who was born
in Georgia in 1806, says that his grandmother, who must have been born
about the middle of the last century, told him that she had heard from
the old people that long before her time a party of giants had come
once to visit the Cherokee. They were nearly twice as tall as common
men, and had their eyes set slanting in their heads, so that the
Cherokee called them Tsunil&prime; k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;, &ldquo;The
Slant-eyed people,&rdquo; because they looked like the giant hunter
Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime; (see the story). They said that these
giants lived very far away in the direction in which the sun goes down.
The Cherokee received them as friends, and they stayed some time, and
then returned to their home in the west. The story may be a distorted
historical tradition.</p>

<h4 class="main">107. THE LOST CHEROKEE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the first lands were sold by the Cherokee, in
1721, a part of the tribe bitterly opposed the sale, saying that if the
Indians once consented to give up any of their territory the whites
would never be satisfied, but would soon want a little more, and a
little again, until at last there would be none left for the Indians.
Finding all they could say not enough to prevent the treaty, they
determined to leave their old homes forever and go far into the West,
beyond the Great river, where the white men could never follow them.
They gave no heed to the entreaties of their friends, but began
preparations for the long march, until the others, finding that they
could not prevent their going, set to work and did their best to fit
them out with pack horses loaded with bread, dried venison, and other
supplies.</p>
<p>When all was ready they started, under the direction of their chief.
A company of picked men was sent with them to help them in crossing the
Great river, and every night until they reached it runners were sent
back to the tribe, and out from the tribe to the marching band, to
carry messages and keep each party posted as to how the other was
getting along. At last they came to the Mississippi, and crossed it by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name=
"pb392">392</a>]</span>the help of those warriors who had been sent
with them. These then returned to the tribe, while the others kept on
to the west. All communication was now at an end. No more was heard of
the wanderers, and in time the story of the lost Cherokee was forgotten
or remembered only as an old tale.</p>
<p>Still the white man pressed upon the Cherokee and one piece of land
after another was sold, until as years went on the dispossessed people
began to turn their faces toward the west as their final resting place,
and small bands of hunters crossed the Mississippi to learn what might
be beyond. One of these parties pushed on across the plains and there
at the foot of the great mountains&mdash;the Rockies&mdash;they found a
tribe speaking the old Cherokee language and living still as the
Cherokee had lived before they had ever known the white man or his
ways.</p>

<h4 class="main">108. THE MASSACRE OF THE
ANI&prime;-KUTA&prime;N&#300;</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among other perishing traditions is that relating to
the Ani&prime;-Kuta&prime;n&#301; or
Ani&prime;-Kw&#259;ta&prime;n&#301;, concerning whom the modern
Cherokee know so little that their very identity is now a matter of
dispute, a few holding that they were an ancient people who preceded
the Cherokee and built the mounds, while others, with more authority,
claim that they were a clan or society in the tribe and were destroyed
long ago by pestilence or other calamity. Fortunately, we are not left
to depend entirely upon surmise in the matter, as the tradition was
noted by Haywood some seventy years ago, and by another writer some
forty years later, while the connected story could still be obtained
from competent authorities. From the various statements it would seem
that the Ani&prime;-Kuta&prime;n&#301; were a priestly clan, having
hereditary supervision of all religious ceremonies among the Cherokee,
until, in consequence of having abused their sacred privileges, they
were attacked and completely exterminated by the rest of the tribe,
leaving the priestly functions to be assumed thereafter by individual
doctors and conjurers.</p>
<p>Haywood says, without giving name or details, &ldquo;The Cherokees
are addicted to conjuration to ascertain whether a sick person will
recover. This custom arose after the destruction of their priests.
Tradition states that such persons lived among their ancestors and were
deemed superior to others, and were extirpated long ago, in consequence
of the misconduct of one of the priests, who attempted to take the wife
of a man who was the brother of the leading chief of the
nation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10898src" href="#xd25e10898"
name="xd25e10898src">31</a></p>
<p>A more detailed statement, on the authority of Chief John Ross and
Dr J. B. Evans, is given in 1866 by a writer who speaks of the massacre
as having occurred about a century before, although from the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393" name=
"pb393">393</a>]</span>dimness of the tradition it is evident that it
must have been much earlier:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The facts, though few, are interesting. The order was
hereditary; in this respect peculiar, for among Indians seldom, and
among the Cherokees never, does power pertain to any family as a matter
of right. Yet the family of the Nicotani&mdash;for it seems to have
been a family or clan&mdash;enjoyed this privilege. The power that they
exercised was not, however, political, nor does it appear that chiefs
were elected from among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Nicotani were a mystical, religious body, of whom the
people stood in great awe, and seem to have been somewhat like the
Brahmins of India. By what means they attained their ascendancy, or how
long it was maintained, can never be ascertained. Their extinction by
massacre is nearly all that can be discovered concerning them. They
became haughty, insolent, overbearing, and licentious to an intolerable
degree. Relying on their hereditary privileges and the strange awe
which they inspired, they did not <span class="corr" id="xd25e10909"
title="Source: hestitate">hesitate</span> by fraud or violence to rend
asunder the tender relations of husband and wife when a beautiful woman
excited their passions. The people long brooded in silence over the
oppressions and outrages of this high caste, whom they deeply hated but
greatly feared. At length a daring young man, a member of an
influential family, organized a conspiracy among the people for the
massacre of the priesthood. The immediate provocation was the abduction
of the wife of the young leader of the conspiracy. His wife was
remarkable for her beauty, and was forcibly abducted and violated by
one of the Nicotani while he was absent on the chase. On his return he
found no difficulty in exciting in others the resentment which he
himself experienced. So many had suffered in the same way, so many
feared that they might be made to suffer, that nothing was wanted but a
leader. A leader appearing in the person of the young brave whom we
have named, the people rose under his direction and killed every
Nicotani, young and old. Thus perished a hereditary secret society,
since which time no hereditary privileges have been tolerated among the
Cherokees.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10912src" href=

<h4 class="main">109. THE WAR MEDICINE</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some warriors had medicine to change their shape as
they pleased, so that they could escape from their enemies. Once one of
these medicine warriors who had been away from home came back and found
a strong party of the enemy attacking the settlement while nearly all
the men were off on a hunt. The town was on the other side of the
river, but his grandmother was there, so he made up his mind to save
her. Going down the stream a little way, he hunted until he found a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394" name=
"pb394">394</a>]</span>mussel shell. With his medicine he changed this
to a canoe, in which he crossed over to his grandmother&rsquo;s house,
and found her sitting there, waiting for the enemy to come and kill
her. Again he made medicine and put her into a small gourd which he
fastened to his belt. Then climbing a tree he changed himself to a
swamp woodcock, and with one cry he spread his wings and flew across to
the other side of the river, where both took their natural shape again
and made their way through the woods to another settlement.</p>
<p>There was another great Cherokee warrior, named
Dasi&#699;giya&prime;g&#301;, or Shoe-boots, as the whites called him,
who lived on Hightower creek, in Georgia. He was so strong that it was
said he could throw a corn mortar over a house, and with his magic
power could clear a river at one jump. His war medicine was an uktena
scale and a very large turtle shell which he got from the Shawano. In
the Creek war he put this scale into water and bathed his body with the
water, and also burned a piece of the turtle shell and drew a black
line around his men with the coal, and he was never wounded and never
had a man killed.</p>
<p>Some great warriors had a medicine by the aid of which they could
dive under the ground as under water, come up among the enemy to kill
and scalp one, then dive under the ground again and come up among their
friends.</p>
<p>Some war captains knew how to put their lives up in the tree tops
during a fight, so that even if they were struck by the enemy they
could not be killed. Once, in a battle with the Shawano, the Cherokee
leader stood directly in front of the enemy and let the whole party
shoot at him, but was not hurt until the Shawano captain, who knew this
war medicine himself, ordered his men to shoot into the branches above
the head of the other. They did this and the Cherokee leader fell
dead.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">110. INCIDENTS OF PERSONAL HEROISM</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Cherokee war of 1760 when small bodies of the
enemy, according to Haywood, were pushing their inroads eastward almost
to Salisbury, a party of six or eight warriors was discovered, watched,
and followed until they were seen to enter a deserted cabin to pass the
night. The alarm was given, and shortly before daylight the whites
surrounded the house, posting themselves behind the fodder stack and
some outbuildings so as to command both the door and the wide chimney
top. They then began to throw fire upon the roof to drive out the
Indians, when, as the blaze caught the dry shingles, and death either
by fire or bullet seemed certain, one of the besieged warriors called
to his companions that it was better that one should be a sacrifice
than that all should die, and that if they would follow his directions
he would save them, but die himself. He proposed to sally out alone to
draw the fire of the besiegers, while his friends stood <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>ready to make for the woods as soon as the guns
of the whites were empty. They agreed, and the door was opened, when he
suddenly rushed forth, dodging and running in a zigzag course, so that
every gun was emptied at him before he fell dead, covered with wounds.
While the whites were reloading, the other warriors ran out and
succeeded in reaching the woods before the besiegers could recover from
their surprise. The historian adds, &ldquo;How greatly it is to be
regretted that the name of this hero is not known to the writer, that
it might be recorded with this specimen of Cherokee bravery and
patriotism, firmness and presence of mind in the hour of
danger.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10939src" href="#xd25e10939"
name="xd25e10939src">33</a></p>
<p>More than once women seem to have shown the courage of warriors when
the occasion demanded. At the beginning of the last century there was
still living among the Cherokee a woman who had killed her
husband&rsquo;s slayer in one of the Revolutionary engagements. For
this deed she was treated with so much consideration that she was
permitted to join the warriors in the war dance, carrying her gun and
tomahawk. The Wahnenauhi manuscript has a tradition of an attack upon a
Cherokee town and the killing of the chief by a hostile war party. His
wife, whose name was Cuhtahlatah
(Gat&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;l&#259;t&#301;, &ldquo;Wild-hemp&rdquo;?), on
seeing her husband fall, snatched up his tomahawk, shouting,
&ldquo;Kill! Kill!&rdquo; and rushed upon the enemy with such fury that
the retreating Cherokee rallied and renewed the battle with so great
courage as to gain a complete victory. This may be a different
statement of the same incident.</p>
<p>In Rutherford&rsquo;s expedition against the Cherokee, in 1776, the
Indians made a stand near Waya gap, in the Nantahala mountains, and a
hard-fought engagement took place, with a loss to the Americans of
nineteen men, although the enemy was finally driven from the ground.
After the main body had retreated, an Indian was seen looking out from
behind a tree, and was at once shot and killed by the soldiers, who, on
going to the spot, found that it was a woman, painted and <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e10946" title="Source: stripped">striped</span> like a
warrior and armed with bow and arrows. She had already been shot
through the thigh, and had therefore been unable to flee with the
rest.</p>

<h4 class="main">111. THE MOUNDS AND THE CONSTANT FIRE: THE OLD SACRED
THINGS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some say that the mounds were built by another people.
Others say they were built by the ancestors of the old
Ani&prime;-K&#301;tu&prime;hwag&#301; for townhouse foundations, so
that the townhouses would be safe when freshets came. The townhouse was
always built on the level bottom lands by the river in order that the
people might have smooth ground for their dances and ballplays and
might be able to go down to water during the dance. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name="pb396">396</a>]</span></p>
<p>When they were ready to build the mound they began by laying a
circle of stones on the surface of the ground. Next they made a fire in
the center of the circle and put near it the body of some prominent
chief or priest who had lately died&mdash;some say seven chief men from
the different clans&mdash;together with an
Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301; stone, an uktena scale or horn,
a feather from the right wing of an eagle or great
tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;, which lived in those days, and beads of seven
colors, red, white, black, blue, purple, yellow, and gray-blue. The
priest then conjured all these with disease, so that, if ever an enemy
invaded the country, even though he should burn and destroy the town
and the townhouse, he would never live to return home.</p>
<p>The mound was then built up with earth, which the women brought in
baskets, and as they piled it above the stones, the bodies of their
great men, and the sacred things, they left an open place at the fire
in the center and let down a hollow cedar trunk, with the bark on,
which fitted around the fire and protected it from the earth. This
cedar log was cut long enough to reach nearly to the surface inside the
townhouse when everything was done. The earth was piled up around it,
and the whole mound was finished off smoothly, and then the townhouse
was built upon it. One man, called the fire keeper, stayed always in
the townhouse to feed and tend the fire. When there was to be a dance
or a council he pushed long stalks of the <i>ihy&acirc;&prime;ga</i>
weed, which some call
<i>atsil&prime;-s&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;t&#301;</i>, &ldquo;the fire
maker&rdquo; (<i lang="la">Erigeron canadense</i> or fleabane), down
through the opening in the cedar log to the fire at the bottom. He left
the ends of the stalks sticking out and piled lichens and punk around,
after which he prayed, and as he prayed the fire climbed up along the
stalks until it caught the punk. Then he put on wood, and by the time
the dancers were ready there was a large fire blazing in the townhouse.
After the dance he covered the hole over again with ashes, but the fire
was always smoldering below. Just before the Green-corn dance, in the
old times, every fire in the settlement was extinguished and all the
people came and got new fire from the townhouse. This was called
<i>atsi&prime;la g&#259;l&ucirc;&ntilde;kw&#700;ti&prime;yu</i>,
&ldquo;the honored or sacred fire.&rdquo; Sometimes when the fire in a
house went out, the woman came to the fire keeper, who made a new fire
by rubbing an ihy&acirc;&prime;ga stalk against the under side of a
hard dry fungus that grows upon locust trees.</p>
<p>Some say this everlasting fire was only in the larger mounds at
N&#301;kw&#259;s&#301;&prime;, K&#301;tu&prime;hwa, and a few other
towns, and that when the new fire was thus drawn up for the Green-corn
dance it was distributed from them to the other settlements. The fire
burns yet at the bottom of these great mounds, and when the Cherokee
soldiers were camped near K&#301;tu&prime;hwa during the civil war they
saw smoke still rising from the mound.</p>
<p>The Cherokee once had a wooden box, nearly square and wrapped up in
buckskin, in which they kept the most sacred things of their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>old religion. Upon every important expedition
two priests carried it in turn and watched over it in camp so that
nothing could come near to disturb it. The Delawares captured it more
than a hundred years ago, and after that the old religion was neglected
and trouble came to the Nation. They had also a great peace pipe,
carved from white stone, with seven stem-holes, so that seven men could
sit around and smoke from it at once at their peace councils. In the
old town of Keowee they had a drum of stone, cut in the shape of a
turtle, which was hung up inside the townhouse and used at all the town
dances. The other towns of the Lower Cherokee used to borrow it, too,
for their own dances.</p>
<p>All the old things are gone now and the Indians are different.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An old man whose wife had died lived alone with his
son. One day he said to the young man, &ldquo;We need a cook here, so
you would better get married.&rdquo; So the young man got a wife and
brought her home. Then his father said, &ldquo;Now we must work
together and do all we can to help her. You go hunting and bring in the
meat and I&rsquo;ll look after the corn and beans, and then she can
cook.&rdquo; The young man went into the woods to look for a deer and
his father went out into the field to attend to the corn. When they
came home at night they were hungry, and the young woman set out a bowl
of walnut hominy (<i>kan&acirc;&prime;talu&prime;h&#301;</i>) before
them. It looked queer, somehow, and when the old man examined it he
found that the walnuts had been put in whole. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t
you shell the walnuts and then beat up the kernels,&rdquo; said he to
the young woman. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know they had to be
shelled,&rdquo; she replied. Then the old man said, &ldquo;You think
about marrying and you don&rsquo;t know how to cook,&rdquo; and he sent
her away.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A man who had a field of growing corn went out one day
to see how it was ripening and climbed a tall stump to get a better
view. The stump was hollow and a bear had a nest of cubs in the bottom.
The man slipped and fell down upon the cubs, which set up such a
squealing that the old she-bear heard them and came climbing down into
the stump tail first, in bear fashion, to see what was the matter. The
man caught hold of her by the hind legs and the old bear was so
frightened that she at once climbed out again, dragging the man, who
thus got out of the stump, when the bear ran away.</p>

<h4 class="main">114. TWO LAZY HUNTERS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A party of warriors once started out for a long
hunting trip in the mountains. They went on until they came to a good
game region, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398" name=
"pb398">398</a>]</span>when they set up their bark hut in a convenient
place near the river side. Every morning after breakfast they scattered
out, each man for himself, to be gone all day, until they returned at
night with whatever game they had taken. There was one lazy fellow who
went out alone every morning like the others, but only until he found a
sunny slope, when he would stretch out by the side of a rock to sleep
until evening, returning then to camp empty-handed, but with his
moccasins torn and a long story of how he had tramped all day and found
nothing. This went on until one of the others began to suspect that
something was wrong, and made it his business to find it out. The next
morning he followed him secretly through the woods until he saw him
come out into a sunny opening, where he sat down upon a large rock,
took off his moccasins, and began rubbing them against the rocks until
he had worn holes in them. Then the lazy fellow loosened his belt, lay
down beside the rock, and went to sleep. The spy set fire to the dry
leaves and watched until the flame crept close up to the sleeping man,
who never opened his eyes.</p>
<p>The spy went back to camp and told what he had seen. About supper
time the lazy fellow came in with the same old story of a long
day&rsquo;s hunt and no game started. When he had finished the others
all laughed and called him a sleepyhead. He insisted that he had been
climbing the ridges all day, and put out his moccasins to show how worn
they were, not knowing that they were scorched from the fire, as he had
slept on until sundown. When they saw the blackened moccasins they
laughed again, and he was too much astonished to say a word in his
defense; so the captain said that such a liar was not fit to stay with
them, and he was driven from the camp.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>There was another lazy fellow who courted a pretty girl, but she
would have nothing to do with him, telling him that her husband must be
a good hunter or she would remain single all her life. One morning he
went into the woods, and by a lucky accident managed to kill a deer.
Lifting it upon his back, he carried it into the settlement, passing
right by the door of the house where the girl and her mother lived. As
soon as he was out of sight of the house he went by a roundabout course
into the woods again and waited until evening, when he appeared with
the deer on his shoulder and came down the trail past the girl&rsquo;s
house as he had in the morning. He did this the next day, and the next,
until the girl began to think he must be killing all the deer in the
woods. So her mother&mdash;the old women are usually the
matchmakers&mdash;got ready and went to the young man&rsquo;s mother to
talk it over.</p>
<p>When she arrived and the greetings were done she said, &ldquo;Your
son must be a good hunter.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the old
woman, &ldquo;he seldom kills anything.&rdquo; &ldquo;But he has been
killing a great many deer lately.&rdquo; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen
any,&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;Why, he has been carrying deer
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399</a>]</span>past our house twice a day for the last three
days.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he did with them,&rdquo;
said the young man&rsquo;s mother; &ldquo;he never brought them
here.&rdquo; Then the girl&rsquo;s mother was sure there was something
wrong, so she went home and told her husband, who followed up the young
man&rsquo;s trail into the woods until it brought him to where the body
of the deer was hidden, now so far decayed that it had to be thrown
away.</p>

and was called Uk-kw&ucirc;n&#259;gi&prime;ta,
&ldquo;Eye-drawn-down.&rdquo; The other had an arm twisted out of shape
and was called Uk-ku&prime;s&ucirc;&ntilde;ts&ucirc;t&#301;,
&ldquo;Bent-bow-shape.&rdquo; They killed a deer and cooked the meat in
a pot. The second old man dipped a piece of bread into the soup and
smacked his lips as he ate it. &ldquo;Is it good?&rdquo; said the first
old man. Said the other, &ldquo;<i>Hay&ucirc;&prime;!
uk-kw&ucirc;n&#259;gi&prime;st&#301;</i>&mdash;Yes, sir! It will draw
down one&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thought the first old man to himself, &ldquo;He means me.&rdquo; So
he dipped a piece of bread into the pot, and smacked his lips as he
tasted it. &ldquo;Do you find it good?&rdquo; said the other old man.
Said his comrade, &ldquo;<i>Hay&ucirc;&prime;!
uk-ku&prime;s&ucirc;&ntilde;ts&ucirc;t&#277;t&#301;&prime;</i>&mdash;Yes,
sir! It will twist up one&rsquo;s arm.&rdquo; Thought the second old
man, &ldquo;He means me&rdquo;; so he got very angry and struck the
first old man, and then they fought until each killed the other.</p>

<h4 class="main">116. THE STAR FEATHERS</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A long time ago a warrior of roving disposition went
down into the white settlements toward the east, where for the first
time he saw a peacock. The beautiful long feathers surprised and
delighted him, and by trading some valuable Indian possession of his
own he managed to buy a few of them, which he took with him to the
mountains and hid, until he was ready to use them, in an old beaver
lodge under the river bank. To get into the beaver lodge he had to dive
under the water.</p>
<p>Then he set to work secretly and made himself a headdress, with the
long peacock feathers in the front and trailing out behind and the
shorter ones at the sides. At the next dance he wore the new headdress,
and asserted that he had been up to the sky and that these were star
feathers (see <a href="#s9">number 9</a>, &ldquo;What the stars are
like&rdquo;). He made a long speech also, which he pretended was a
message he had received from the star spirits to deliver to the
people.</p>
<p>Everyone wondered at the beautiful feathers, so different from any
they had ever seen before. They made no doubt that he had been up to
the sky and talked with spirits. He became a great prophet, and used to
keep himself hidden all day in the beaver hole, and whenever there was
a night gathering for a dance or a council he would suddenly appear
among them wearing his feather headdress and give <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span>the
people a new message from the sky. Then he would leave them again,
pretending that he went up to heaven.</p>
<p>He grew famous and powerful among all the medicine men, until at
last it happened that another Cherokee went down among the white
settlements and saw there another peacock, and knew at once that the
prophet was a fraud. On his return he quietly told some of his friends,
and they decided to investigate. When the next night dance came around
the prophet was on hand as usual with a new message fresh from the
stars. The people listened reverently, and promised to do all that he
commanded. Then he left them, saying that he must return at once to the
sky, but as he went out from the circle the spies followed him in the
darkness, and saw him go down to the river and dive under the water.
They waited, but he did not come up again, and they went back and told
the people. The next morning a party went to the spot and discovered
the beaver lodge under the bank. One man dived and came up inside, and
there he found the prophet sitting with the peacock feathers by his
side.</p>

<h4 class="main">119. WHEN BABIES ARE BORN: THE WREN AND THE
CRICKET</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The little Wren is the messenger of the birds, and
pries into everything. She gets up early in the morning and goes round
to every house in the settlement to get news for the bird council. When
a new baby is born she finds out whether it is a boy or girl and
reports to the council. If it is a boy the birds sing in mournful
chorus: &ldquo;Alas! the whistle of the arrow! my shins will
burn,&rdquo; because the birds know that when the boy grows older he
will hunt them with his blowgun and arrows and roast them on a
stick.</p>
<p>But if the baby is a girl, they are glad and sing: &ldquo;Thanks!
the sound of the pestle! At her home I shall surely be able to scratch
where she sweeps,&rdquo; because they know that after a while they will
be able to pick up stray grains where she beats the corn into meal.</p>
<p>When the Cricket hears that a girl is born, it also is glad, and
says, &ldquo;Thanks, I shall sing in the house where she lives.&rdquo;
But if it is a boy the Cricket laments: <span class="corr" id=

shoot me! He will shoot me! He will shoot me!&rdquo; because boys make
little bows to shoot crickets and grasshoppers.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">120. THE RAVEN MOCKER</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of all the Cherokee wizards or witches the most
dreaded is the Raven Mocker (<i>K&acirc;&prime;lan&ucirc;
Ahyeli&prime;sk&#301;</i>), the one that robs the dying man of life.
They are of either sex and there is no sure way to know one, though
they usually look withered and old, because they have added so many
lives to their own.</p>
<p>At night, when some one is sick or dying in the settlement, the
Raven Mocker goes to the place to take the life. He flies through the
air in fiery shape, with arms outstretched like wings, and sparks
trailing behind, and a rushing sound like the noise of a strong wind.
Every little while as he flies he makes a cry like the cry of a raven
when it &ldquo;dives&rdquo; in the air&mdash;not like the common raven
cry&mdash;and those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402"
name="pb402">402</a>]</span>who hear are afraid, because they know that
some man&rsquo;s life will soon go out. When the Raven Mocker comes to
the house he finds others of his kind waiting there, and unless there
is a doctor on guard who knows how to drive them away they go inside,
all invisible, and frighten and torment the sick man until they kill
him. Sometimes to do this they even lift him from the bed and throw him
on the floor, but his friends who are with him think he is only
struggling for breath.</p>
<p>After the witches kill him they take out his heart and eat it, and
so add to their own lives as many days or years as they have taken from
his. No one in the room can see them, and there is no scar where they
take out the heart, but yet there is no heart left in the body. Only
one who has the right medicine can recognize a Raven Mocker, and if
such a man stays in the room with the sick person these witches are
afraid to come in, and retreat as soon as they see him, because when
one of them is recognized in his right shape he must die within seven
days. There was once a man named
G&ucirc;&ntilde;sk&#259;li&prime;sk&#301;, who had this medicine and
used to hunt for Raven Mockers, and killed several. When the friends of
a dying person know that there is no more hope they always try to have
one of these medicine men stay in the house and watch the body until it
is buried, because after burial the witches do not steal the heart.</p>
<p>The other witches are jealous of the Raven Mockers and afraid to
come into the same house with one. Once a man who had the witch
medicine was watching by a sick man and saw these other witches outside
trying to get in. All at once they heard a Raven Mocker cry overhead
and the others scattered &ldquo;like a flock of pigeons when the hawk
swoops.&rdquo; When at last a Raven Mocker dies these other witches
sometimes take revenge by digging up the body and abusing it.</p>
<p>The following is told on the reservation as an actual happening:</p>
<p>A young man had been out on a hunting trip and was on his way home
when night came on while he was still a long distance from the
settlement. He knew of a house not far off the trail where an old man
and his wife lived, so he turned in that direction to look for a place
to sleep until morning. When he got to the house there was nobody in
it. He looked into the &acirc;s&#301; and found no one there either. He
thought maybe they had gone after water, and so stretched himself out
in the farther corner to sleep. Very soon he heard a raven cry outside,
and in a little while afterwards the old man came into the
&acirc;s&#301; and sat down by the fire without noticing the young man,
who kept still in the dark corner. Soon there was another raven cry
outside, and the old man said to himself, &ldquo;Now my wife is
coming,&rdquo; and sure enough in a little while the old woman came in
and sat down by her husband. Then the young man knew they were Raven
Mockers and he was frightened and kept very quiet. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name="pb403">403</a>]</span></p>
<p>Said the old man to his wife, &ldquo;Well, what luck did you
have?&rdquo; &ldquo;None,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;there were
too many doctors watching. What luck did you have?&rdquo; &ldquo;I got
what I went for,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;there is no reason to
fail, but you never have luck. Take this and cook it and let&rsquo;s
have something to eat.&rdquo; She fixed the fire and then the young man
smelled meat roasting and thought it smelled sweeter than any meat he
had ever tasted. He peeped out from one eye, and it looked like a
man&rsquo;s heart roasting on a stick.</p>
<p>Suddenly the old woman said to her husband, &ldquo;Who is over in
the corner?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Yes,
there is,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;I hear him snoring,&rdquo;
and she stirred the fire until it blazed and lighted up the whole
place, and there was the young man lying in the corner. He kept quiet
and pretended to be asleep. The old man made a noise at the fire to
wake him, but still he pretended to sleep. Then the old man came over
and shook him, and he sat up and rubbed his eyes as if he had been
asleep all the time.</p>
<p>Now it was near daylight and the old woman was out in the other
house getting breakfast ready, but the hunter could hear her crying to
herself. &ldquo;Why is your wife crying?&rdquo; he asked the old man.
&ldquo;Oh, she has lost some of her friends lately and feels
lonesome,&rdquo; said her husband; but the young man knew that she was
crying because he had heard them talking.</p>
<p>When they came out to breakfast the old man put a bowl of corn mush
before him and said, &ldquo;This is all we have&mdash;we have had no
meat for a long time.&rdquo; After breakfast the young man started on
again, but when he had gone a little way the old man ran after him with
a fine piece of beadwork and gave it to him, saying, &ldquo;Take this,
and don&rsquo;t tell anybody what you heard last night, because my wife
and I are always quarreling that way.&rdquo; The young man took the
piece, but when he came to the first creek he threw it into the water
and then went on to the settlement. There he told the whole story, and
a party of warriors started back with him to kill the Raven Mockers.
When they reached the place it was seven days after the first night.
They found the old man and his wife lying dead in the house, so they
set fire to it and burned it and the witches together.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;From the head of the southern branch of
Savannah river it does not exceed half a mile to a head spring of the
Missisippi water that runs through the middle and upper parts of the
Cheerake nation about a northwest course, and, joining other rivers,
they empty themselves into the great Missisippi. The above fountain is
called &lsquo;Herbert&rsquo;s spring,&rsquo; so named from an early
commissioner of Indian affairs, and it was natural for strangers to
drink thereof, to quench thirst, gratify their curiosity, and have it
to say they had drank of the French waters. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name="pb404">404</a>]</span>Some
of our people, who went only with the view of staying a short time, but
by some allurement or other exceeded the time appointed, at their
return reported, either through merriment or superstition, that the
spring had such a natural bewitching quality that whosoever drank of it
could not possibly quit the nation during the tedious space of seven
years. All the debauchees readily fell in with this superstitious
notion as an excuse for their bad method of living, when they had no
proper call to stay in that country; and in process of time it became
as received a truth as any ever believed to have been spoken by the
Delphic oracle. One cursed, because its enchantment had marred his good
fortune; another condemned his weakness for drinking down witchcraft,
against his own secret suspicions; one swore he would never taste
another such dangerous poison, even though he should be forced to go
down to the Missisippi for water; and another comforted himself that so
many years out of the seven were already passed, and wished that if
ever he tasted it again, though under the greatest necessity, he might
be confined to the Stygian waters. Those who had their minds more
enlarged diverted themselves much at their cost, for it was a noted
favorite place, on account of the name it went by; and, being a well
situated and good spring, there all travelers commonly drank a bottle
of choice. But now most of the pack-horse men, though they be dry, and
also matchless sons of Bacchus, on the most pressing invitations to
drink there, would swear to forfeit sacred liquor the better part of
their lives rather than basely renew or confirm the loss of their
liberty, which that execrable fountain occasions.&rdquo;&mdash;Adair,

</div>
<p><span class="sc">Atsi&prime;la-wa&prime;&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Fire&rsquo;s relative,&rdquo; a peak, sometimes spoken of as
Rattlesnake knob, east of Oconaluftee river and about 2 miles northeast
of Cherokee or Yellow Hill, in Swain county. So called from a tradition
that a ball of fire was once seen to fly through the air from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name=
"pb405">405</a>]</span>the direction of Highlands, in Macon county, and
alight upon this mountain. The Indians believe it to have been an
ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;t&#301; (see <a href="#s50">number 50</a>),
which its owner had kept in a hiding place upon the summit, from which,
after his death, it issued nightly to search for him.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Black rock</span>: A very high bald peak toward the
head of Scott&rsquo;s creek, northeast of Webster, on the line of
Jackson and Haywood counties. Either this peak or the adjacent Jones
knob, of equal height, is known to the Cherokee as
&Ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;w&#259;d&acirc;-tsu&#699;gilas&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;,
&ldquo;Where the storehouse was taken off,&rdquo; from a large flat
rock, supported by four other rocks, so as to resemble a storehouse
(<i>&ucirc;&ntilde;w&#259;d&acirc;&prime;l&#301;</i>) raised on poles,
which was formerly in prominent view upon the summit until thrown down
by lightning some fifty years ago.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Buffalo creek, West</span>: A tributary of Cheowa
river, in Graham county. The Cherokee name is
Y&ucirc;ns&acirc;i&prime;&#301;, &ldquo;Buffalo place,&rdquo; from a
tradition that a buffalo formerly lived under the water at its mouth
(see Tsuta&prime;tsinas&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;).</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cheowa Maximum</span>: A bald mountain at the head
of Cheowa river, on the line between Graham and Macon counties. This
and the adjoining peak, Swim bald, are together called
Sehwate&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Hornet place,&rdquo; from a monster
hornet, which, according to tradition, formerly had its nest there, and
could be seen flying about the tree tops or sunning itself on the bald
spots, and which was so fierce that it drove away every one who came
near the mountain. It finally disappeared.</p>
<p><span class="sc">D&#259;kw&acirc;&prime;&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;D&#259;kw&#259;&prime; place,&rdquo; in French Broad river,
about 6 miles above Warm Springs, in Madison county, and 30 miles below
Asheville. A d&#259;kw&#259;&prime; or monster fish is said to have
lived in the stream at that point.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Da&prime;&#699;nawa-(a)
Sa&prime;&#699;ts&ucirc;&ntilde;y&#301;</span>: &ldquo;War
crossing,&rdquo; a ford in Cheowa river about 3 miles below
Robbinsville, in Graham county. A hostile war party from the North,
probably Shawano or Iroquois, after having killed a man on Cheowa, was
pursued and crossed the river at this place.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Datle&prime;y&#259;sta&prime;&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where they fell down,&rdquo; on Tuckasegee river, at the bend
above Webster, in Jackson county, where was formerly the old town of
G&#259;ns&acirc;&prime;g&#301; (Conasauga). Two large uktenas, twined
about each other as though in combat, were once seen to lift themselves
from a deep hole in the river there and fall back into the water.</p>
<p><span class="sc">D&acirc;tsi&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;D&acirc;ts&#301; place,&rdquo; just above Eagle creek, on Little
Tennessee river, between Graham and Swain counties. So called from a
traditional water monster of that name, said to have lived in a deep
hole in the stream.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Degal&#699;g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where they are piled up,&rdquo; a series of cairns on both sides
of the trail down the south side of Cheowa river, in Graham county.
They extend along the trail for several miles, from below Santeetla
creek nearly to Slick Rock creek, on the Tennessee line (the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=
"pb406">406</a>]</span>first being just above
Disg&acirc;&prime;gisti&prime;y&#301;, q. v.), and probably mark the
site of an ancient battle. One at least, nearly off Yellow creek, is
reputed to be the grave of a Cherokee killed by the enemy. Every
passing Indian throws an additional stone upon each heap, believing
that some misfortune will befall him should he neglect this duty. Other
cairns are on the west side of Slick Rock creek about a mile from
Little Tennessee river, and others south of Robbinsville, near where
the trail crosses the ridge to Valleytown, in Cherokee county.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dida&prime;skasti&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where they were afraid of each other,&rdquo; a spot on the east
side of Little Tennessee river, near the mouth of Alarka creek, in
Swain county. A ball game once arranged to take place there, before the
Removal, between rival teams from Qualla and Valleytown, was abandoned
on account of the mutual fear of the two parties.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Disg&acirc;&prime;gisti&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where they gnaw,&rdquo; a spot where the trail down the south
side of Cheowa river crosses a small branch about half way between
Cockram creek and Yellow creek, in Graham county. Indians passing gnaw
the twigs from the laurel bushes here, in the belief that if they
should fail to do so they will encounter some misfortune before
crossing the next ridge. Near by is a cairn to which each also adds a
stone (see Degal&#699;g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;).</p>
<p><span class=
"sc">Dudu&ntilde;&prime;l&#277;ks&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where its legs were broken off,&rdquo; a spot on the east side
of Tuckasegee river, opposite the mouth of Cullowhee river, a few miles
above Webster, in Jackson county. The name suggests a tradition, which
appears to be lost.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Dulast&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Potsherd place,&rdquo; a former settlement on Nottely river, in
Cherokee county, near the Georgia line. A half-breed Cherokee ball
captain who formerly lived there, John Butler or
Tsan-uga&prime;s&#301;t&#259; (Sour John), having been defeated in a
ball game, said, in contempt of his men, that they were of no more use
than broken pots.</p>
<p><span class=
"sc">Dunid&ucirc;&prime;lal&ucirc;&ntilde;y&#301;</span>: &ldquo;Where
they made arrows,&rdquo; on Straight creek, a head-stream of
Oconaluftee river, near Cataluchee peak, in Swain county. A Shawano war
party coming against the Cherokee, after having crossed the Smoky
mountains, halted there to prepare arrows.</p>
<p><span class="sc">French Broad river</span>: A magazine writer states
that the Indians called this stream &ldquo;the racing river.&rdquo;
This is only partially correct. The Cherokee have no name for the river
as a whole, but the district through which it flows about Asheville is
called by them Un-ta&prime;kiyasti&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Where they
race.&rdquo; The name of the city they translate as
K&acirc;sdu&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Ashes place.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gakati&prime;y&#301;</span>: &ldquo;Place of
setting free,&rdquo; a south bend in Tuckasegee river about 3 miles
above Bryson City, in Swain county. It is sometimes put in the plural
form, Diga&prime;katiy&#301;, &ldquo;Place of setting them free.&rdquo;
In one of their old wars the Cherokee generously released some
prisoners there. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407"
name="pb407">407</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Gatuti&prime;y&#301;</span>: &ldquo;Town-building
place,&rdquo; near the head of Santeetla creek, southwest from
Robbinsville, in Graham county. High up on the slopes of the
neighboring mountain, Stratton bald, is a wide &ldquo;bench,&rdquo;
where the people once started to build a settlement, but were
frightened off by a strange noise, which they thought was made by an
uktena.</p>
<p><span class=
"sc">Gi&#699;l&#301;&prime;-Din&#277;h&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where the dogs live,&rdquo; a deep place in Oconaluftee river,
Swain county, a short distance above Yellow Hill (Cherokee) and just
below the mound. It is so named from a tradition that two &ldquo;red
dogs&rdquo; were once seen there playing on the bank. They were
supposed to live under the water.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Giseh&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where the Female lives,&rdquo; on Tuckasegee river, about 2
miles above Bryson City, Swain county. There is a tradition that some
supernatural &ldquo;white people&rdquo; were seen there washing clothes
in the river and hanging them out upon the bank to dry. They were
probably supposed to be the family of the Agis&prime;-e&prime;gwa, or
&ldquo;Great Female,&rdquo; a spirit invoked by the conjurers.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gregory bald</span>: A high peak of the Great Smoky
mountains on the western border of Swain county, adjoining Tennessee.
The Cherokee call it Tsistu&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Rabbit place.&rdquo;
Here the rabbits had their townhouse and here lived their chief, the
Great Rabbit, and in the old times the people could see him. He was as
large as a deer, and all the little rabbits were subject to him.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Joanna bald</span>: A bald mountain near the head
of Valley river, on the line between Graham and Cherokee counties.
Called Diy&acirc;&prime;h&#259;li&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Lizard
place,&rdquo; from a traditional great lizard, with glistening throat,
which used to haunt the place and was frequently seen sunning itself on
the rocky slopes.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Jutaculla old fields</span>: A bald spot of perhaps
a hundred acres on the slope of Tennessee bald
(Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime; Tsuneg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;),
at the extreme head of Tuckasegee river, in Jackson county, on the
ridge from which the lines of Haywood, Jackson, and Transylvania
counties diverge. The giant Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;, or
Jutaculla, as the name is corrupted by the whites, had his residence in
the mountain (see story), and according to local legend among the
whites, said to be derived from the Indians, this bald spot was a
clearing which he made for a farm. Some distance farther to the west,
on the north bank of Cany fork, about 1 mile above Moses creek and
perhaps 10 miles above Webster, in the same county, is the Jutaculla
rock, a large soapstone slab covered with rude carvings, which,
according to the same tradition, are scratches made by the giant in
jumping from his farm on the mountain to the creek below.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Jutaculla rock</span>: See Jutaculla old
fields.</p>
<p><span class=
"sc">K&acirc;l-Detsi&prime;y&ucirc;&ntilde;y&#301;</span>: &ldquo;Where
the bones are,&rdquo; a ravine on the north side of Cheowa river, just
above the mouth of East Buffalo creek, in Graham county. In the old
time two Cherokee were killed here by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb408" href="#pb408" name="pb408">408</a>]</span>the enemy, and their
fate was unknown until, long afterward, their friends found their bones
scattered about in the ravine.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nantahala</span>: A river and ridge of very steep
mountains in Macon county, the name being a corruption of
N&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;d&#259;ye&prime;&#699;l&#301;, applied to a
former settlement about the mouth of Briertown creek, the townhouse
being on the west side of the river, about the present Jarretts. The
word means &ldquo;middle sun,&rdquo; i. e., &ldquo;midday sun,&rdquo;
from <i>n&ucirc;&ntilde;d&#259;&prime;</i>, &ldquo;sun,&rdquo; and
<i>aye&prime;&#699;l&#301;</i>, &ldquo;middle,&rdquo; and refers to the
fact that in places along the stream the high cliffs shut out the
direct light of the sun until nearly noon. From a false idea that it is
derived from <i>un&ucirc;&ntilde;t&#301;</i>, &ldquo;milk,&rdquo; it
has been fancifully rendered, &ldquo;Center of a woman&rsquo;s
breast,&rdquo; &ldquo;Maiden&rsquo;s bosom,&rdquo; etc. The valley was
the legendary haunt of the Uw&#700;ts&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;ta (see
<a href="#s45">number 45</a>). As illustrating the steepness of the
cliffs along the stream it was said of a noted hunter,
Tsasta&prime;w&#301;, who lived in the old town, that he used to stand
on the top of the bluff overlooking the settlement and throw down upon
the roof of his house the liver of the freshly killed deer, so that his
wife would have it cooked and waiting for him by the time he got down
the mountain.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nug&#259;tsa&prime;n&#301;</span>: A ridge below
Yellow Hill (Cherokee), on Oconaluftee river, in Swain county, said to
be a resort of the N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; fairies. The
word is an archaic form denoting a high ridge with a long, gradual
slope.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Qualla</span>: A post-office and former trading
station in Jackson county, on the border of the present East Cherokee
reservation, hence sometimes called the Qualla reservation. The
Cherokee form is Kwal&#301;, or Kwal&ucirc;&ntilde;y&#301; in the
locative. According to Captain Terrell, the former trader at that
place, it was named from Kwal&#301;, i. e., Polly, an old Indian woman
who lived there some sixty years ago.</p>
<p><span class="sc">S&#259;ligu&prime;g&#301;</span>: &ldquo;Turtle
place,&rdquo; a deep hole in Oconaluftee river, about half a mile below
Adams creek, near Whittier, in Swain county, said to be the resort of a
monster turtle.</p>
<p><span class=
"sc">Skwan&prime;-dig&ucirc;&#699;g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</span>:
For Askwan&prime;-dig&ucirc;&#699;g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Where the Spaniard is in the water,&rdquo; on Soco creek, just
above the entrance of Wright&rsquo;s creek, in Jackson county.
According to tradition a party of Spaniards advancing into the
mountains was attacked here by the Cherokee, who threw one of them
(dead?) into the stream.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Soco gap</span>: &#258;h&#259;lu&prime;na,
&#258;&prime;h&#259;lun&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, or
Uni&prime;h&#259;lu&prime;na, &ldquo;Ambush,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Where
they ambushed&rdquo;; at the head of Soco creek, on the line between
Swain and Haywood counties. The trail from Pigeon river crosses this
gap, and in the old times the Cherokee were accustomed to keep a
lookout here for the approach of enemies from the north. On the
occasion which gave it the name, they ambushed here, just below the
gap, on the Haywood side, a large party of invading Shawano, and killed
all but one, whose ears they cut off, after which, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name=
"pb409">409</a>]</span>according to a common custom, they released him
to carry the news back to his people.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Standing Indian</span>: A high bald peak at the
extreme head of Nantahala river, in Macon county. The name is a
rendering of the Cherokee name,
Y&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;w&#301;-tsulen&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Where the man stood&rdquo; (originally
Y&ucirc;&prime;&ntilde;w&#301;-d&#301;kat&acirc;g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Where the man stands&rdquo;), given to it on account of a
peculiarly shaped rock formerly jutting out from the bald summit, but
now broken off. As the old memory faded, a tradition grew up of a
mysterious being once seen standing upon the mountain top.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Stekoa</span>: A spot on Tuckasegee river, just
above Whittier, in Swain county, better known as the Thomas farm, from
its being the former residence of Colonel W. H. Thomas, for a long time
the agent of the East Cherokee. The correct form is
Stik&acirc;&prime;y&#301;, the name of an ancient settlement at the
place, as also of another on a creek of the same name in Rabun county,
Georgia. The word has been incorrectly rendered &ldquo;little
grease,&rdquo; from <i>usdi&prime;ga</i> or <i>usdi&prime;</i>,
&ldquo;little,&rdquo; and <i>ka&prime;&#301;</i>, &ldquo;grease&rdquo;
or &ldquo;oil,&rdquo; but the true meaning is lost.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Swannanoa</span>: A river joining the French Broad
at Asheville, and the gap in the Blue ridge at its head. A magazine
writer has translated this name &ldquo;the beautiful.&rdquo; The word,
however, is a corruption of
Suwa&prime;li-n&ucirc;&ntilde;n&acirc;&prime;(-h&#301;), &ldquo;Suwali
trail,&rdquo; the Cherokee name, not of the stream, but of the trail
crossing the gap toward the country of the
Ani&prime;-Suwa&prime;l&#301; or Cheraw (see <a href="#s104">number
104</a>, &ldquo;The Eastern Tribes&rdquo;).</p>
<p><span class="sc">Swim bald or Wolf Creek bald.</span> See Cheowa

<p><span class=
"sc">Tsi&prime;skwunsdi&prime;-adsisti&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where they killed Little-bird,&rdquo; a place near the head of
West Buffalo creek, southwest of Robbinsville, in Graham county. A
trail crosses the ridge near this place, which takes its name from a
man who was killed here by a hostile war party in the old fighting
days.</p>
<p><span class=
"sc">Tsu&prime;din&ucirc;&ntilde;ti&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Throwing down place,&rdquo; the site of a former settlement in a
bend on the west side of Nantahala river, just within the limits of
Macon county. So called from a tradition that a Cherokee pursued by the
enemy threw away his equipment there.</p>
<p><span class=
"sc">Tsukil&ucirc;&ntilde;n&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where he alighted,&rdquo; two small bald spots on the side of
the mountain at the head of Little Snowbird creek, southwest of
Robbinsville, in Graham county. A mysterious being, having the form of
a giant, with head blazing like the sun, was once seen to fly through
the air, alight at this place, and stand for some time looking out over
the landscape. It then flew away, and when the people came afterward to
look, they found the herbage burned from the ground where it had stood.
They do not know who it was, but some think it may have been the
Sun.</p>
<p><span class=
"sc">Tsul&acirc;&prime;sin&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where the footprint is,&rdquo; on Tuckasegee river, about a mile
above Deep creek, in Swain county. From a rock now <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name=
"pb410">410</a>]</span>blasted out to make way for the railroad, on
which were impressions said to have been the footprints of the giant
Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime; (see <a href="#s81">story</a>) and a
deer.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tsunda&#699;nilti&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where they demanded the debt from him,&rdquo; a fine camping
ground, on the north side of Little Santeetla creek, about halfway up,
west from Robbinsville, Graham county. Here a hunter once killed a
deer, which the others of the party demanded in payment of a debt due
them. The Cherokee commonly give the creek the same name.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ts&ucirc;ta&prime;ga
Uwey&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;&#301;</span>: &ldquo;Chicken creek,&rdquo;
an extreme eastern head-stream of Nantahala river, entering about 4
miles above Clear branch, in Macon county. So called from a story that
some hunters camping there for the night once heard a noise as of
chickens constantly crowing upon a high rock farther up the stream.</p>
<p><span class=
"sc">Tsuta&prime;tsin&acirc;s&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where it eddies,&rdquo; a deep hole at the mouth of Cockram
creek of Cheowa river, in Graham county, where is an eddy said to be
caused by a buffalo which lives under the water at this spot, and which
anciently lived at the mouth of West Buffalo creek, farther up the
river.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tusquittee bald</span>: A bald mountain at the head
of Tusquittee creek, eastward from Hayesville, in Clay county. The
Cherokee name is
Tsuw&#259;&prime;-uniyets&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Where,
the water-dogs laughed,&rdquo; the water-dog of the southern
Alleghenies, sometimes also called mud-puppy or hell-bender, being a
large amphibious lizard or salamander of the genus <i>Menopoma</i>,
frequenting muddy waters. According to the story, a hunter once
crossing over the mountain in a very dry season, heard voices, and
creeping silently toward the place from which the sound proceeded,
peeped over a rock and saw two water-dogs walking together on their
hind legs along the trail and talking as they went. Their pond had
dried up and they were on the way over to Nantahala river. As he
listened one said to the other, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the water?
I&rsquo;m so thirsty that my apron (gills) hangs down,&rdquo; and then
both water-dogs laughed.</p>
<p><span class=
"sc">Ukte&prime;na-tsugan&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;tats&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where the uktena fastened,&rdquo; a spot on Tuckasegee river,
about 2 miles above Deep creek, near Bryson City, in Swain county.
There is a tradition that an uktena, trying to make his way upstream,
became fastened here, and in his struggles pried up some large rocks
now lying in the bed of the river, and left deep scratches upon other
rocks along the bank.</p>
<p><span class=
"sc">Ukte&prime;na-utansi&prime;nast&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where the uktena crawled,&rdquo; a large rock on the Hyatt farm,
on the north bank of Tuckasegee river, about four miles above Bryson
City, in Swain county. In the rock bed of the stream and along the
rocks on the side are wavy depressions said to have been made by an
uktena in going up the river.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Untlasg&acirc;sti&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where they scratched,&rdquo; at the head of Hyatt creek, of
Valley river, in Cherokee county. According to hunting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411" name=
"pb411">411</a>]</span>tradition, every animal on arriving at this spot
was accustomed to scratch the ground like a turkey.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Vengeance creek</span>: A south tributary of Valley
river, in Cherokee county. So called by the first settlers from an old
Indian woman who lived there and whom they nicknamed
&ldquo;Vengeance,&rdquo; on account of her cross looks. The Cherokee
call the district G&#259;nsa&#699;ti&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Robbing
place,&rdquo; from their having robbed a trader there in the
Revolution.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Waya gap</span>: A gap in the Nantahala mountains,
in Macon county, where the trail crosses from Laurel creek of Nantahala
river to Cartoogaja creek of the Little Tennessee. The Cherokee call it
A&#699;t&acirc;hi&prime;ta, &ldquo;Shouting place.&rdquo; For the
tradition see <a href="#s13">number 13</a>. It was the scene of a
stubborn encounter in the Revolution (see page <a href="#pb49" class=
"pageref">49</a>). The name Waya appears to be from the Cherokee
<i>w&#259;&prime;&#699;ya</i>, &ldquo;wolf.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Webster</span>: The county seat of Jackson county,
on Tuckasegee river. Known to the Cherokee as Unadanti&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Where they conjured.&rdquo; The name properly belongs to a gap 3
miles east of Webster, on the trail going up Scotts creek. According to
tradition, a war party of Shawano, coming from the direction of Pigeon
river, halted here to &ldquo;make medicine&rdquo; against the Cherokee,
but while thus engaged were surprised by the latter, who came up from
behind and killed several, including the conjurer.</p>
<p><span class=

&ldquo;Where the bears live,&rdquo; on Oconaluftee river, about a mile
above its junction with Tuckasegee, in Swain county. A family of
&ldquo;water bears&rdquo; is said to live at the bottom of the river in
a deep hole at this point.</p>
<p><span class=
"sc">Y&acirc;&prime;n&ucirc;-u&prime;n&#259;tawasti&prime;y&#301;</span>:
&ldquo;Where the bears wash,&rdquo; a small pond of very cold, purple
water, which has no outlet and is now nearly dried up, in a gap of the
Great Smoky mountains, at the extreme head of Raven fork of
Oconaluftee, in Swain county. It was said to be a favorite bear wallow,
and according to some accounts its waters had the same virtues ascribed
to those of Atag&acirc;&prime;h&#301; (see <a href="#s69">number
69</a>).</p>
<p><span class="sc">Yaw&acirc;&prime;&#301;</span>: &ldquo;Yawa
place,&rdquo; a spot on the south side of Yellow creek of Cheowa river,
in Graham county, about a mile above the trail crossing near the mouth
of the creek. The legend is that a mysterious personage, apparently a
human being, formerly haunted a round knob near there, and was
sometimes seen walking about the top of the knob and crying,
<i>Yaw&#259;&prime;! Yaw&#259;&prime;!</i> while the sound of invisible
guns came from the hill, so that the people were afraid to go near
it.</p>

"pb412">412</a>]</span>succeeded to the inheritance have built
traditions of more or less doubtful authenticity.</p>
<p>In Pickens and Anderson counties, in the northwest corner of the
state, is a series of creeks joining Keowee river and named,
respectively in order, from above downward, Mile, Six-mile,
Twelve-mile, Eighteen-mile, Twenty-three-mile, and Twenty-six-mile.
According to the local story, they were thus christened by a young
woman, in one of the early Indian wars, as she crossed each ford on a
rapid horseback flight to the lower settlements to secure help for the
beleaguered garrison of Fort Prince George. The names really date back
almost to the first establishment of the colony, and were intended to
indicate roughly the distances along the old trading path from Fort
Ninety-six, on Henleys creek of Saluda river, to Keowee, at that time
the frontier town of the Cherokee Nation, the two points being
considered 96 miles apart as the trail ran. Fort Prince George was on
the east bank of Keowee river, near the entrance of Crow creek, and
directly opposite the Indian town.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Conneross</span>: The name of a creek which enters
Keowee (or Seneca) river from the west, in Anderson county; it is a
corruption of the Lower Cherokee dialectic form,
K&#259;w&acirc;n&prime;-ur&acirc;&prime;s&ucirc;&ntilde;y&#301; or
K&#259;w&acirc;n&prime;-tsur&acirc;&prime;-s&ucirc;&ntilde;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Where the duck fell off.&rdquo; According to the still surviving
Cherokee tradition, a duck once had her nest upon a cliff overlooking
the stream in a cave with the mouth so placed that in leaving the nest
she appeared to fall from the cliff into the water. There was probably
an Indian settlement of the same name:</p>
<p><span class="sc">Toxaway</span>: The name of a creek and former
Cherokee settlement at the extreme head of Keowee river; it has been
incorrectly rendered &ldquo;Place of shedding tears,&rdquo; from
<i>daks&#259;wa&prime;ih&ucirc;</i>, &ldquo;he is shedding
tears.&rdquo; The correct Cherokee form of the name is
D&ucirc;ksa&prime;&#301; or D&ucirc;kw&#700;sa&prime;&#301;, a word
which can not be analyzed and of which the meaning is now lost.</p>

U&#699;tl&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;ta.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Buffalo Track rock</span>: This rock, of which the
Indian name is now lost, is indefinitely mentioned as located southwest
from Cumberland gap, on the northern border of the state. According to
Wafford, it was well known some eighty years ago to the old Cherokee
hunters, who described it as covered with deep impressions made by
buffalo running along the rock and then butting their heads, as though
in mad fury, against a rock wall, leaving the prints of their heads and
horns in the stone.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chattanooga</span>: This city, upon Tennessee
river, near the entrance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href=
"#pb413" name="pb413">413</a>]</span>of the creek of the same name in
Hamilton county, was incorporated in 1848. So far as is known there was
no Cherokee settlement at the place, although some prominent men of the
tribe lived in the vicinity. The name originally belonged to some
location upon the creek. The Cherokee pronounce it
Tsat&#259;nu&prime;g&#301;, but say that it is not a Cherokee word and
has no meaning in their language. The best informants express the
opinion that it was from the Chickasaw (Choctaw) language, which seems
possible, as the Chickasaw country anciently extended a considerable
distance up the Tennessee, the nearest settlement being within 80 miles
of the present city. The Cherokee sometimes call the city
A&#699;tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;&prime;, &ldquo;Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;
(Hawk) hole,&rdquo; that being their old name for a bluff on the south
side of the river at the foot of the present Market street. From this
circumstance probably originated the statement by a magazine writer
that the name Chattanooga signifies &ldquo;The crow&rsquo;s
nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chickamauga</span>: The name of two creeks in
Hamilton county, entering Tennessee river from opposite sides a few
miles above Chattanooga. A creek of the same name is one of the
head-streams of Chattahoochee river, in White county, Georgia. The
Cherokee pronounce it Ts&#301;k&#259;ma&prime;g&#301;, applying the
name in Tennessee to the territory about the mouth of the southern, or
principal, stream, where they formerly had a town, from which they
removed in 1782. They state, however, that it is not a Cherokee word
and has no meaning in their language. Filson, in 1793, erroneously
states that it is from the Cherokee language and signifies
&ldquo;Boiling pot,&rdquo; referring to a dangerous whirlpool in the
river near by, and later writers have improved upon this by translating
it to mean &ldquo;Whirlpool.&rdquo; The error arises from confounding
this place with The Suck, a whirlpool in Tennessee river 15 miles
farther down and known to the Cherokee as
&Ucirc;&ntilde;tiguh&#301;&prime;, &ldquo;Pot in the water&rdquo; (see
<a href="#s63">number 63</a>, &ldquo;&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime;,
the Gambler&rdquo;). On account of the hard fighting in the
neighborhood during the Civil war, the stream was sometimes called,
poetically, &ldquo;The River of Death,&rdquo; the term being frequently
given as a translation of the Indian word. It has been suggested that
the name is derived from an Algonquian word referring to a fishing or
fish-spearing place, in which case it may have originated with the
Shawano, who formerly occupied middle Tennessee, and some of whom at a
later period resided jointly with the Cherokee in the settlements along
this part of the river. If not Shawano it is probably from the Creek or
Chickasaw.</p>
<p>Concerning &ldquo;Chickamauga gulch,&rdquo; a canyon on the northern
stream of that name, a newspaper writer gives the following so-called
legend, which it is hardly necessary to say is not genuine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The Cherokees were a tribe singularly rich in
tradition, and of course so wild, gloomy, and remarkable a spot was not
without its legend. The descendants of the expatriated semi-barbarians
believe to this day that in ages gone a great serpent made <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>its
den in the gulch, and that yearly he demanded of the red men ten of
their most beautiful maidens as a sacrificial offering. Fearful of
extermination, the demand was always complied with by the tribe, amid
weeping and wailing by the women. On the day before the tribute was due
the serpent announced its presence by a demoniacal hiss, and the next
morning the fair ones who had been chosen to save the tribe were taken
to the summit of a cliff and left to be swallowed by the scaly
Moloch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Chilhowee</span>: A mountain and station on the
north side of Little Tennessee river, in Blount county. The correct
Cherokee form is Ts&ucirc;&#699;l&ucirc;&ntilde;we&prime;&#301;,
applied to the lower part of Abrams creek, which enters the river from
the north just above. The meaning of the word is lost, although it may
possibly have a connection with <i>ts&ucirc;&#699;l&ucirc;</i>,
&ldquo;kingfisher.&rdquo; It has been incorrectly rendered &ldquo;fire
deer,&rdquo; an interpretation founded on the false assumption that the
name is compounded from <i>atsi&prime;la</i>, &ldquo;fire,&rdquo; and
<i>a&#699;w&#301;&prime;</i>, &ldquo;deer,&rdquo; whence, Chil-howee.
For legends localized in this vicinity, see the stories noted above.
Chilhowee occurs also as the name of a stream in the mountains of
southwestern Virginia.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Lenoir</span>: On the north bank of the main
Tennessee, at the junction of the Little Tennessee, in Loudon county.
The Cherokee name is Wa&prime;g&#301;ns&#301;&prime;, of which the
meaning is lost, and was applied originally to an eddy in the stream,
where, it was said, there dwelt a large serpent, to see which was an
omen of evil. On one occasion a man crossing the river at this point
saw the snake in the water and soon afterward lost one of his
children.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Morganton</span>: On a rocky hill on the old Indian
trail on the west side of Little Tennessee river, above and nearly
opposite Morganton, in Loudon county, are, or were a few years ago,
four trees blazed in a peculiar manner, concerning which the Indians
had several unsatisfactory stories, the most common opinion being that
the marks were very old and had been made by Indians to indicate the
position of hidden mines.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nashville</span>: The state capital, in Davidson
county. The Cherokee name is
D&#259;g&ucirc;&prime;n&#259;wel&#259;&prime;h&#301;,
&ldquo;Mussel-liver place,&rdquo; which would seem to have originated
in some now forgotten legend.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nickajack</span>: A creek entering Tennessee river
from the south about 15 miles below Chattanooga. Near its mouth is a
noted cave of the same name. The Cherokee form is
N&#301;kutse&prime;g&#301;, the name of a former settlement of that
tribe at the mouth of the creek; but the word has no meaning in that
language, and is probably of foreign, perhaps Chickasaw, origin. The
derivation from a certain &ldquo;Nigger Jack,&rdquo; said to have made
the cave his headquarters is purely fanciful.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Savannah</span>: A farm on the north bank of
Hiwassee river at a ford of the same name, about 5 miles above
Conasauga creek and Columbus, in Polk county. Here are extensive
remains of an ancient settlement, including mounds, cemetery, and also,
some seventy years ago, a small <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415"
href="#pb415" name="pb415">415</a>]</span>square inclosure or
&ldquo;fort&rdquo; of undressed stone. According to a tradition given
to Wafford, the Cherokee once prepared an ambush here for a hostile war
party which they were expecting to come up the river, but were
themselves defeated by the enemy, who made a detour around the Black
mountain and came in upon their rear.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tennessee</span>: The Cherokee form is
T&#259;n&#259;s&#301;&prime;, and was applied to several localities
within the old territory of the tribe. The most important town of this
name was on the south bank of Little Tennessee river, halfway between
Citico and Toco creeks, in Monroe county, Tennessee. Another was on the
south side of Hiwassee, just above the junction of Ocoee, in Polk
county, Tennessee. A third district of the same name was on Tennessee
creek, the extreme easterly head of Tuckasegee river, in Jackson
county, North Carolina. The meaning of the name is lost. It was not the
Indian name of the river, and does not mean &ldquo;Big spoon,&rdquo; as
has been incorrectly asserted.</p>

for the Uktena, and The Man who Married the Thunder&rsquo;s Sister.
White&rsquo;s Historical Collections of Georgia is responsible for a
number of pseudo-myths.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chopped oak</span>: A noted tree, scarred with
hundreds of hatchet marks, formerly in Habersham county, 6 miles east
of Clarkesville, on the summit of Chattahoochee ridge, and on the north
side of the road from Clarkesville to Toccoa creek. The Cherokee name
is Dig&#259;lu&prime;y&#259;t&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Where it is gashed with hatchets.&rdquo; It was a favorite
assembly place for the Indians, as well as for the early settlers,
according to whom the gashes were tally marks by means of which the
Indians kept the record of scalps taken in their forays. The tradition
is thus given by White (Historical Collections of Georgia, p. 489,
1855) on some earlier authority:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Among the curiosities of this country was the Chopped
Oak, a tree famous in Indian history and in the traditions of the early
settlers. This tree stood about 6 miles southeast of Clarkesville, and
was noted as being the Law Ground, or place of holding company musters
and magistrates&rsquo; courts. According to tradition, the Chopped Oak
was a celebrated rendezvous of the Indians in their predatory
excursions, it being at a joint where a number of trails met. Here
their plans of warfare were laid; here the several parties separated;
and here, on their return, they awaited each other; and then, in their
brief language, the result of their enterprise was stated, and for
every scalp taken a gash cut in the tree. If tradition tells the truth,
and every scar on the blasted oak counts for a scalp, the success of
their scouting parties must have been great. This tree was alive a few
years since when a young man, possessing all the prejudices of his
countrymen, and caring less for the traditions of the Indians than his
own revenge, killed the tree by girdling it, that it might be no longer
a living monument of the cruelties of the savages. The stump is still
standing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name=
"pb416">416</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Dead Man&rsquo;s gap</span>: One mile below
Tallulah falls, on the west side of the railroad, in Habersham county.
So called from a former reputed Indian grave, now almost obliterated.
According to the story, it was the grave of an Indian who was killed
here while eloping with a white woman, whom he had stolen from her
husband.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Frogtown</span>: A creek at the head of Chestatee
river, north of Dahlonega, in Lumpkin county. The Cherokee name is
Wal&acirc;si&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Frog place.&rdquo; The name was
originally applied to a mountain to the northeast (Rock mountain?),
from a tradition that a hunter had once seen there a frog as large as a
house. The Indian settlement along the creek bore the same name.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hiwassee</span>: A river having its source in Towns
county, of northern Georgia, and flowing northwestward to join the
Tennessee. The correct Cherokee form, applied to two former settlements
on the stream, is Ayuhwa&prime;s&#301; (meaning &ldquo;A
savanna&rdquo;). Although there is no especial Cherokee story connected
with the name, White (Historical Collections of Georgia, p. 660) makes
it the subject of a long pseudo-myth, in which Hiwassee, rendered
&ldquo;The Pretty Fawn,&rdquo; is the beautiful daughter of a Catawba
chief, and is wooed, and at last won, by a young Cherokee warrior named
Notley, &ldquo;The Daring Horseman,&rdquo; who finally becomes the head
chief of the Cherokee and succeeds in making perpetual peace between
the two tribes. The story sounds very pretty, but is a pure
invention.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nacoochee</span>: A village on the site of a former
Cherokee settlement, in a beautiful and fertile valley of the same name
at the head of Chattahoochee river, in White county. The Cherokee form
is Nagu&#699;ts&#301;&prime;, but the word has no meaning in that
language and seems to be of foreign, perhaps Creek, origin. About 2
miles above the village, on the east bank of the river, is a large
mound. White (Historical Collections of Georgia, p. 486) quotes a
fictitious legend, according to which Nacoochee, &ldquo;The Evening
Star,&rdquo; was a beautiful Indian princess, who unfortunately fell in
love with a chieftain of a hostile tribe and was killed, together with
her lover, while fleeing from the vengeance of an angry father. The two
were buried in the same grave and the mound was raised over the spot.
The only grain of truth in the story is that the name has a slight
resemblance to <i>n&#259;kw&#301;s&#301;&prime;</i>, the Cherokee word
for &ldquo;star.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nottely</span>: A river rising in Union county and
flowing northwestward into Hiwassee. The Cherokee form is
Na&prime;d&ucirc;&#699;l&#301;&prime;, applied to a former settlement
on the west side of the river, in Cherokee county, North Carolina,
about a mile from the Georgia line. Although suggestive of
<i>na&#699;t&ucirc;&#699;l&#301;</i>, &ldquo;spicewood,&rdquo; it is a
different word and has no meaning in the Cherokee language, being
apparently of foreign, perhaps Creek, origin. For a pseudo-myth
connected with the name, see the preceding note on Hiwassee.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=
"pb417">417</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Talking Rock</span>: A creek in upper Georgia
flowing northward to join Coosawatee river. The Indian settlements upon
it were considered as belonging to Sanderstown, on the lower part of
the creek, the townhouse being located about a mile above the present
Talking Rock station on the west side of the railroad. The name is a
translation of the Cherokee
N&ucirc;&ntilde;y&ucirc;&prime;-g&ucirc;&ntilde;wani&prime;sk&#301;,
&ldquo;Rock that talks,&rdquo; and refers, according to one informant,
to an echo rock somewhere upon the stream below the present railroad
station. An old-time trader among the Cherokee in Georgia says that the
name was applied to a rock at which the Indians formerly held their
councils, but the etymology of the word is against this derivation.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tallulah</span>: A river in Rabun county,
northeastern Georgia, which flows into the Tugaloo, and has a beautiful
fall about 2 miles above its mouth. The Cherokee form is
T&#259;lul&#365;&prime; (T&#259;rur&#301;&prime; in the lower Cherokee
dialect), the name of an ancient settlement some distance above the
falls, as also of a creek and district at the head of Cheowa river, in
Graham county, North Carolina. The name can not be translated. A
magazine writer has rendered it &ldquo;The Terrible,&rdquo; for which
there is no authority. Schoolcraft, on the authority of a Cherokee
lady, renders it &ldquo;There lies your child,&rdquo; derived from a
story of a child having been carried over the falls. The name, however,
was not applied to the falls, but to a district on the stream above, as
well as to another in North Carolina. The error arises from the fact
that a word of somewhat similar sound denotes &ldquo;having
children&rdquo; or &ldquo;being pregnant,&rdquo; used in speaking of a
woman. One informant derives it from <i>t&#259;lul&#365;&prime;</i>,
the cry of a certain species of frog known as <i>dulus&#301;</i>, which
is found in that neighborhood, but not upon the reservation, and which
was formerly eaten as food. A possible derivation is from
<i>a&prime;t&#259;lul&ucirc;&prime;</i>, &ldquo;unfinished, premature,
unsuccessful.&rdquo; The fall was called
Ug&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, a name of which the meaning is lost,
and which was applied also to a locality on Little Tennessee river near
Franklin, North Carolina. For a myth localized at Tallulah falls, see
<a href="#s84">number 84</a>, &ldquo;The Man who Married the
Thunder&rsquo;s Sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this connection Lanman gives the following story, which,
notwithstanding its white man&rsquo;s dress, appears to be based upon a
genuine Cherokee tradition of the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">During my stay at the Falls of Tallulah I made every
effort to obtain an Indian legend or two connected with them, and it
was my good fortune to hear one which has never yet been printed. It
was originally obtained by the white man who first discovered the falls
from the Cherokees, who lived in the region at the time. It is in
substance as follows: Many generations ago it so happened that several
famous hunters, who had wandered from the West toward what is now the
Savannah river, in search of game, never returned to their camping
grounds. In process of time the curiosity as well as the fears of the
nation were excited, and an effort was made to ascertain the cause of
their singular disappearance, whereupon a party of medicine men were
deputed to make a pilgrimage toward the great river. They were absent a
whole moon, and, on returning to their friends, they reported that they
had discovered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418" name=
"pb418">418</a>]</span>a dreadful fissure in an unknown part of the
country, through which a mountain torrent took its way with a deafening
noise. They said that it was an exceedingly wild place, and that its
inhabitants were a species of little men and women, who dwelt in the
crevices of the rocks and in grottoes under the waterfalls. They had
attempted by every artifice in their power to hold a council with the
little people, but all in vain; and, from the shrieks they frequently
uttered, the medicine men knew that they were the enemies of the Indian
race, and, therefore, it was concluded in the nation at large that the
long-lost hunters had been decoyed to their death in the dreadful
gorge, which they called Tallulah. In view of this little legend, it is
worthy of remark that the Cherokee nation, previous to their departure
for the distant West, always avoided the Falls of Tallulah, and were
seldom found hunting or fishing in their vicinity.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e11643src" href="#xd25e11643" name="xd25e11643src">34</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Toccoa</span>: (1) A creek flowing into Tugaloo
river, in Habersham county, with a fall upon its upper course, near the
village of the same name. (2) A river in upper Georgia, flowing
northwestward into Hiwassee. The correct Cherokee form applied to the
former settlement on both streams is Tagw&acirc;&prime;h&#301;,
&ldquo;Catawba place,&rdquo; implying the former presence of Indians of
that tribe. The lands about Toccoa falls were sold by the Cherokee in
1783 and were owned at one time by Wafford&rsquo;s grandfather.
According to Wafford, there was a tradition that when the whites first
visited the place they saw, as they thought, an Indian woman walking
beneath the surface of the water under the falls, and on looking again
a moment after they saw her sitting upon an overhanging rock 200 feet
in the air, with her feet dangling over. Said Wafford, &ldquo;She must
have been one of the N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Track Rock gap</span>: A gap about 5 miles east of
Blairsville, in Union county, on the ridge separating Brasstown creek
from the waters of Nottely river. The micaceous soapstone rocks on both
sides of the trail are covered with petroglyphs, from which the gap
takes its name. The Cherokee call the place
Datsu&prime;nal&acirc;sg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Where
there are tracks,&rdquo; or Degayel&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;h&#259;,
&ldquo;Printed (Branded) place.&rdquo; The carvings are of many and
various patterns, some of them resembling human or animal footprints,
while others are squares, crosses, circles, &ldquo;bird tracks,&rdquo;
etc., disposed without any apparent order. On the authority of a Doctor
Stevenson, writing in 1834, White (Historical Collections of Georgia,
p. 658, 1855), and after him Jones (Antiquities of the Southern
Indians, 1873), give a misleading and greatly exaggerated account of
these carvings, without having taken the trouble to investigate for
themselves, although the spot is easily accessible. No effort, either
state or local, is made to preserve the pictographs from destruction,
and many of the finest have been cut out from the rock and carried off
by vandals, Stevenson himself being among the number, by his own
confession. The illustration (plate <span class="sc">XX</span>) is from
a rough sketch made by the author in 1890.</p>

</div>
<p>The Cherokee have various theories to account for the origin of the
carvings, the more sensible Indians saying that they were made by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span>hunters for their own amusement while resting in
the gap. Another tradition is that they were made while the surface of
the newly created earth was still soft by a great army of birds and
animals fleeing through the gap to escape some pursuing danger from the
west&mdash;some say a great &ldquo;drive hunt&rdquo; of the Indians.
Haywood confounds them with other petroglyphs in North Carolina
connected with the story of the giant Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;
(see <a href="#s81">number 81</a>).</p>
<p>The following florid account of the carvings and ostensible Indian
tradition of their origin is from White, on the authority of
Stevenson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The number visible or defined is 136, some of them
quite natural and perfect, and others rather rude imitations, and most
of them from the effects of time have become more or less obliterated.
They comprise human feet from those 4 inches in length to those of
great warriors which measure 17&frac12; inches in length and 7&frac34;
in breadth across the toes. What is a little curious, all the human
feet are natural except this, which has 6 toes, proving him to have
been a descendant of Titan. There are 26 of these impressions, all bare
except one, which has the appearance of having worn moccasins. A fine
turned hand, rather delicate, occupied a place near the great warrior,
and probably the impression of his wife&rsquo;s hand, who no doubt
accompanied her husband in all his excursions, sharing his toils and
soothing his cares away. Many horse tracks are to be seen. One seems to
have been shod, some are very small, and one measures 12&frac12; inches
by 9&frac12; inches. This the Cherokee say was the footprint of the
great war horse which their chieftain rode. The tracks of a great many
turkeys, turtles, terrapins, a large bear&rsquo;s paw, a snake&rsquo;s
trail, and the footprints of two deer are to be seen. The tradition
respecting these impressions varies. One asserts that the world was
once deluged with water, and men with all animated beings were
destroyed, except one family, together with various animals necessary
to replenish the earth; that the Great Spirit before the floods came
commanded them to embark in a big canoe, which after long sailing was
drawn to this spot by a bevy of swans and rested there, and here the
whole troop of animals was disembarked, leaving the impressions as they
passed over the rock, which being softened by reason of long submersion
kindly received and preserved them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">War Woman&rsquo;s creek</span>: Enters Chattooga
river in Rabun county, northeastern Georgia, in the heart of the old
Lower Cherokee country. The name seems to be of Indian origin, although
the Cherokee name is lost and the story has perished. A writer quoted
by White (Historical Collections of Georgia, p. 444) attempts to show
its origin from the exploit of a certain Revolutionary amazon, in
capturing a party of Tories, but the name occurs in Adair (note, p.
185) as early as 1775. There is some reason for believing that it
refers to a former female dignitary among the Cherokee, described by
Haywood under the title of the &ldquo;Pretty Woman&rdquo; as having
authority to decide the fate of prisoners of war. Wafford once knew an
old woman whose name was Da&#699;n&#259;-g&acirc;&prime;st&#259;, an

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Cherokee have always been an agricultural people,
and their old country is a region of luxuriant flora, with tall trees
and tangled undergrowth on the slopes and ridges, and myriad
bright-tinted blossoms and sweet wild fruits along the running streams.
The vegetable kingdom consequently holds a far more important place in
the mythology and ceremonial of the tribe than it does among the
Indians of the treeless plains and arid sage deserts of the West, most
of the beliefs and customs in this connection centering around the
practice of medicine, as expounded by the priests and doctors in every
settlement. In general it is held that the plant world is friendly to
the human species, and constantly at the willing service of the doctors
to counteract the jealous hostility of the animals. The sacred formulas
contain many curious instructions for the gathering and preparation of
the medicinal roots and barks, which are selected chiefly in accordance
with the theory of correspondences.</p>
<p>The Indians are close observers, and some of their plant names are
peculiarly apt. Thus the mistletoe, which never grows alone, but is
found always with its roots fixed in the bark of some supporting tree
or shrub from which it draws its sustenance, is called by a name which
signifies &ldquo;it is married&rdquo; (<i>uda&prime;&#699;l&#301;</i>).
The violet is still called by a plural name,
<i>dinda&prime;skwate&prime;sk&#301;</i>, &ldquo;they pull each
other&rsquo;s heads off,&rdquo; showing that the Cherokee children have
discovered a game not unknown among our own. The bear-grass (<i lang=
"la">Eryngium</i>), with its long, slender leaves like diminutive
blades of corn, is called <i>s&#259;likw&acirc;&prime;y&#301;</i>,
&ldquo;greensnake,&rdquo; and the larger grass known as Job&rsquo;s
tears, on account of its glossy, rounded grains, which the Indian
children use for necklaces, is called <i>sel-uts&#301;&prime;</i>,
&ldquo;the mother of corn.&rdquo; The black-eyed Susan
(<i>Rudbeckia</i>) of our children is the &ldquo;deer-eye&rdquo;
(<i>a&#699;w&#301;&prime;-akt&#259;&prime;</i>) of the Cherokee, and
our lady-slipper (<i lang="la">Cypripedium</i>) is their
&ldquo;partridge moccasin&rdquo;
(<i>g&#365;gw&#277;&prime;-ulasu&prime;la</i>). The May-apple (<i lang=
"la">Podophyllum</i>), with its umbrella-shaped top, is called
<i>u&prime;niskwetu&prime;&#699;g&#301;</i>, meaning &ldquo;it wears a
hat,&rdquo; while the white puffball fungus is
<i>n&#259;kw&#301;s&#301;&prime;-usdi&prime;</i>, &ldquo;the little
star,&rdquo; and the common rock lichen bears the musical, if rather
unpoetic, name of <i>uts&#259;le&prime;ta</i>, &ldquo;pot
scrapings.&rdquo; Some plants are named from their real or supposed
place in the animal economy, as the wild rose,
<i>tsist-uni&prime;gist&#301;</i>, &ldquo;the rabbits eat
it&rdquo;&mdash;referring to the seed berries&mdash;and the shield fern
(<i lang="la">Aspidium</i>), <i>y&acirc;n-utse&prime;st&ucirc;</i>,
&ldquo;the bear lies on it.&rdquo; Others, again, are named from their
domestic or ceremonial uses, as the fleabane (<i>Erigeron
canadense</i>), called
<i>atsil&prime;-s&ucirc;&ntilde;&#699;t&#301;</i>, &ldquo;fire
maker,&rdquo; because its dried stalk was anciently employed in
producing fire by friction, and the bugle weed (<i>Lycopus
virginicus</i>), known as <i>aniwani&prime;sk&#301;</i>,
&ldquo;talkers,&rdquo; because the chewed root, given to children to
swallow, or rubbed upon their lips, is supposed to endow them with the
gift of eloquence. Some few, in addition to the ordinary term in use
among the common people, have a sacred or symbolic name, used
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name=
"pb421">421</a>]</span>only by the priests and doctors in the prayer
formulas. Thus ginseng, or &ldquo;sang,&rdquo; as it is more often
called by the white mountaineers, is known to the laity as
<i>&acirc;&prime;tal&#301;-g&ucirc;l&#301;&prime;</i>, &ldquo;the
mountain climber,&rdquo; but is addressed in the formulas as
<i>Y&ucirc;&ntilde;w&#301; Usdi&prime;</i>, &ldquo;Little Man,&rdquo;
while <i>selu</i> (corn) is invoked under the name of
<i>Agawe&prime;la</i> in myths, as, for instance, that of <i lang=
"la">Prosartes lanuginosa</i>, which bears the curious name of
<i>wal&acirc;s&prime;-un&ucirc;l&prime;st&#301;</i>, &ldquo;frogs fight
with it,&rdquo; from a story that in the long
ago&mdash;<i>h&#301;lahi&prime;yu</i>&mdash;two quarrelsome frogs once
fought a duel, using its stalks as lances. In the locative form this
was the name of a former Cherokee settlement in Georgia, called by the
whites Fighting-town, from a misapprehension of the meaning of the
word. Of the white clover, the Cherokee say that &ldquo;it follows the
white man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The division of trees into evergreen and deciduous is accounted for
by a myth, related elsewhere, according to which the loss of their
leaves in winter time is a punishment visited upon the latter for their
failure to endure an ordeal to the end. With the Cherokee, as with
nearly all other tribes east and west, the cedar is held sacred above
other trees. The reasons for this reverence are easily found in its
ever-living green, its balsamic fragrance, and the beautiful color of
its fine-grained wood, unwarping and practically undecaying. The small
green twigs are thrown upon the fire as incense in certain ceremonies,
particularly to counteract the effect of asgina dreams, as it is
believed that the anisgi&prime;na or malevolent ghosts can not endure
the smell; but the wood itself is considered too sacred to be used as
fuel. In the war dance, the scalp trophies, stretched on small hoops,
were hung upon a cedar sapling trimmed and decorated for the occasion.
According to a myth the red color comes originally from the blood of a
wicked magician, whose severed head was hung at the top of a tall
cedar. The story is now almost forgotten, but it was probably nearly
identical with one still existing among the Yuchi, former neighbors of
the Cherokee. According to the Yuchi myth, a malevolent magician
disturbed the daily course of the sun until at last two brave warriors
sought him out and killed him in his cave. They cut off his head and
brought it home with them to show to the people, but it continued still
alive. To make it die they were advised to tie it in the topmost
branches of a tree. This they did, trying one tree after another, but
each morning the head was found at the foot of the tree and still
alive. At last they tied it in a cedar, and there the head remained
until it was dead, while the blood slowly trickling down along the
trunk gave the wood its red color, and henceforth the cedar was a
&ldquo;medicine&rdquo; tree.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11786src" href=
"#xd25e11786" name="xd25e11786src">35</a></p>
<p>The linn or basswood (<i>Tilia</i>) is believed never to be struck
by lightning, and the hunter caught in one of the frequent
thunderstorms of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422"
name="pb422">422</a>]</span>the southern mountains always seeks its
shelter. From its stringy bark are twisted the hunting belts worn about
the waist. Sourwood (<i lang="la">Oxydendrum</i>) is used by the
hunters for barbecue sticks to roast meat before the fire, on account
of the acid flavor of the wood, which they believe to be thus
communicated to the meat. Spoons and combs are also carved from the
wood, but it is never burned, from an idea that lye made from the ashes
will bring sickness to those who use it in preparing their food. It is
said also that if one should sleep beside a fire containing sourwood
sticks the sourwood &ldquo;will barbecue him,&rdquo; which may possibly
mean that he will have hot or feverish pains thereafter.</p>
<p>The laurel, in its two varieties, large and small
(<i>Rhododendron</i> and <i>Kalmia</i>, or &ldquo;ivy&rdquo;), is much
used for spoons and combs, on account of its close grain, as also in
medicine, but is never burned, as it is believed that this would bring
on cold weather, and would furthermore destroy the medicinal virtues of
the whole species. The reason given is that the leaves, when burning,
make a hissing sound suggestive of winter winds and falling snow. When
the doctor is making up a compound in which any part of the laurel is
an ingredient, great precautions are taken to prevent any of the leaves
or twigs being swept into the fire, as this would render the decoction
worthless. Sassafras is tabued as fuel among the Cherokee, as also
among their white neighbors, perhaps for the practical reason that it
is apt to pop out of the fire when heated and might thus set the house
on fire.</p>
<p>Pounded walnut bark is thrown into small streams to stupefy the
fish, so that they may be easily dipped out in baskets as they float on
the surface of the water. Should a pregnant woman wade into the stream
at the time, its effect is nullified, unless she has first taken the
precaution to tie a strip of the bark about her toe. A fire of post-oak
and the wood of the <i>tel&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;l&#259;t&#301;</i> or
summer grape (<i lang="la">Vitis &aelig;stivalis</i>) is believed to
bring a spell of warm weather even in the coldest winter season.</p>
<p>Mysterious properties attach to the wood of a tree which has been
struck by lightning, especially when the tree itself still lives, and
such wood enters largely into the secret compounds of the conjurers. An
ordinary person of the laity will not touch it, for fear of having
cracks come upon his hands and feet, nor is it burned for fuel, for
fear that lye made from the ashes will cause consumption. In preparing
ballplayers for the contest, the medicine-man sometimes burns splinters
of it to coal, which he gives to the players to paint themselves with
in order that they may be able to strike their opponents with all the
force of a thunderbolt. Bark or wood from a tree struck by lightning,
but still green, is beaten up and put into the water in which seeds are
soaked before planting, to insure a good crop, but, on the other hand,
any lightning-struck wood thrown into the field will cause the crop to
wither, and it is believed to have a bad effect even to go into the
field immediately after having been near such a tree. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name="pb423">423</a>]</span></p>
<p>Among all vegetables the one which holds first place in the
household economy and ceremonial observance of the tribe is
<i>selu</i>, &ldquo;corn,&rdquo; invoked in the sacred formulas under
the name of Agawe&prime;la, &ldquo;The Old Woman,&rdquo; in allusion to
its mythic origin from the blood of an old woman killed by her
disobedient sons (see <a href="#s3">number 3</a>,
&ldquo;Kana&prime;t&#301; and Selu&rdquo;). In former times the annual
thanksgiving ceremony of the Green-corn dance, preliminary to eating
the first new corn, was the most solemn tribal function, a propitiation
and expiation for the sins of the past year, an amnesty for public
criminals, and a prayer for happiness and prosperity for the year to
come. Only those who had properly prepared themselves by prayer,
fasting, and purification were allowed to take part in this ceremony,
and no one dared to taste the new corn until then. Seven ears from the
last year&rsquo;s crop were always put carefully aside, in order to
<i>attract the corn</i> until the new crop was ripened and it was time
for the dance, when they were eaten with the rest. In eating the first
new corn after the Green Corn dance, care was observed not to blow upon
it to cool it, for fear of causing a wind storm to beat down the
standing crop in the field.</p>
<p>Much ceremony accompanied the planting and tending of the crop.
Seven grains, the sacred number, were put into each hill, and these
were not afterward thinned out. After the last working of the crop, the
priest and an assistant&mdash;generally the owner of the
field&mdash;went into the field and built a small inclosure
(<i>dets&#259;n&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;l&#301;</i>) in the center. Then
entering it, they seated themselves upon the ground, with heads bent
down, and while the assistant kept perfect silence the priest, with
rattle in hand, sang songs of invocation to the spirit of the corn.
Soon, according to the orthodox belief, a loud rustling would be heard
outside, which they would know was caused by the &ldquo;Old
Woman&rdquo; bringing the corn into the field, but neither must look up
until the song was finished. This ceremony was repeated on four
successive nights, after which no one entered the field for seven other
nights, when the priest himself went in, and, if all the sacred
regulations had been properly observed, was rewarded by finding young
ears upon the stalks. The corn ceremonies could be performed by the
owner of the field himself, provided he was willing to pay a sufficient
fee to the priest in order to learn the songs and ritual. Care was
always taken to keep a clean trail from the field to the house, so that
the corn might be encouraged to stay at home and not go wandering
elsewhere. Most of these customs have now fallen into disuse excepting
among the old people, by many of whom they are still religiously
observed.</p>
<p>Another curious ceremony, of which even the memory is now almost
forgotten, was enacted after the first working of the corn, when the
owner or priest stood in succession at each of the four corners of the
field and wept and wailed loudly. Even the priests are now unable to
give a reason for this performance, which may have been a lament
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424" name=
"pb424">424</a>]</span>for the bloody death of Selu, as the women of
Byblos were wont to weep for Adonis.</p>
<p>Next to corn, the bean (<i>tuya</i>) is the most important food
plant of the Cherokee and other southern Indians, with whom it is
probably native, but there does not appear to be much special ceremony
or folklore in connection with it. Beans which crack open in cooking
are sometimes rubbed by mothers on the lips of their children in order
to make them look smiling and good-tempered. The association of ideas
seems to be the same as that which in Ireland causes a fat mealy
potato, which cracks open in boiling, to be called a
&ldquo;laughing&rdquo; potato. Melons and squashes must not be counted
or examined too closely, while still growing upon the vine, or they
will cease to thrive; neither must one step over the vine, or it will
wither before the fruit ripens. One who has eaten a May-apple must not
come near the vines under any circumstances, as this plant withers and
dries up very quickly, and its presence would make the melons wither in
the same way.</p>
<p>Tobacco was used as a sacred incense or as the guarantee of a solemn
oath in nearly every important function&mdash;in binding the warrior to
take up the hatchet against the enemy, in ratifying the treaty of
peace, in confirming sales or other engagements, in seeking omens for
the hunter, in driving away witches or evil spirits, and in regular
medical practice. It was either smoked in the pipe or sprinkled upon
the fire, never rolled into cigarettes, as among the tribes of the
Southwest, neither was it ever smoked for the mere pleasure of the
sensation. Of late years white neighbors have taught the Indians to
chew it, but the habit is not aboriginal. It is called
<i>ts&acirc;l&ucirc;</i>, a name which has lost its meaning in the
Cherokee language, but is explained from the cognate Tuscarora, in
which <i>charh&ucirc;&prime;</i>, &ldquo;tobacco,&rdquo; can still be
analyzed as &ldquo;fire to hold in the mouth,&rdquo; showing that the
use is as old as the knowledge of the plant. The tobacco originally in
use among the Cherokee, Iroquois, and other eastern tribes was not the
common tobacco of commerce (<i lang="la">Nicotiana tabacum</i>), which
has been introduced from the West Indies, but the <i lang=
"la">Nicotiana rustica</i>, or wild tobacco, now distinguished by the
Cherokee as <i>ts&acirc;l-ag&#259;y&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;li</i>,
&ldquo;old tobacco,&rdquo; and by the Iroquois as &ldquo;real
tobacco.&rdquo; Its various uses in ritual and medicine are better
described under other headings. For the myth of its loss and recovery
see <a href="#s6">number 6</a>, &ldquo;How They Brought Back the
Tobacco.&rdquo; The cardinal flower (<i lang="la">Lobelia</i>), mullein
(<i lang="la">Verbascum</i>), and one or two related species are called
<i>ts&acirc;liyu&prime;st&#301;</i>, &ldquo;like tobacco,&rdquo; on
account of their general resemblance to it in appearance, but they were
never used in the same way.</p>
<p>The poisonous wild parsnip (<i lang="la">Peucedanum</i>?) bears an
unpleasant reputation on account of its frequent use in evil spells,
especially those intended to destroy the life of the victim. In one of
these conjurations seven pieces of the root are laid upon one hand and
rubbed gently <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name=
"pb425">425</a>]</span>with the other, the omen being taken from the
position of the pieces when the hand is removed. It is said also that
poisoners mix it secretly with the food of their intended victim, when,
if he eats, he soon becomes drowsy, and, unless kept in motion until
the effect wears off, falls asleep, never to wake again. Suicides are
said to eat it to procure death. Before starting on a journey a small
piece of the root is sometimes chewed and blown upon the body to
prevent sickness, but the remedy is almost as bad as the disease, for
the snakes are said to resent the offensive smell by biting the one who
carries it. In spite of its poisonous qualities, a decoction of the
root is much used for steaming patients in the sweat bath, the idea
seeming to be that the smell drives away the disease spirits.</p>
<p>The poison oak or poison ivy (<i lang="la">Rhus radicans</i>), so
abundant in the damp eastern forests, is feared as much by Indians as
by whites. When obliged to approach it or work in its vicinity, the
Cherokee strives to conciliate it by addressing it as &ldquo;My
friend&rdquo; (<i>hi&prime;g&#301;nali&#301;</i>). If poisoned by it,
he rubs upon the affected part the beaten flesh of a crawfish.</p>
<p>One variety of brier (<i lang="la">Smilax</i>) is called
<i>di&#699;n&ucirc;&prime;sk&#301;</i>, &ldquo;the breeder,&rdquo; from
a belief that a thorn of it, if allowed to remain in the flesh, will
breed others in a day or two.</p>
<p>Ginseng, which is sold in large quantities to the local traders, as
well as used in the native medical practice, is called
<i>&acirc;tal&#301;-g&ucirc;l&#301;&prime;</i>, &ldquo;the mountain
climber,&rdquo; but is addressed by the priests as
Y&ucirc;&ntilde;w&#301; Usdi&prime;, &ldquo;Little Man,&rdquo; or
Y&ucirc;&ntilde;wi Usdi&prime;ga Ada&prime;wehi&prime;yu, &ldquo;Little
Man, Most Powerful Magician,&rdquo; the Cherokee sacred term, like the
Chinese name, having its origin from the frequent resemblance of the
root in shape to the body of a man. The beliefs and ceremonies in
connection with its gathering and preparation are very numerous. The
doctor speaks constantly of it as of a sentient being, and it is
believed to be able to make itself invisible to those unworthy to
gather it. In hunting it, the first three plants found are passed by.
The fourth is taken, after a preliminary prayer, in which the doctor
addresses it as the &ldquo;Great Ada&prime;weh&#301;,&rdquo; and humbly
asks permission to take a small piece of its flesh. On digging it from
the ground, he drops into the hole a bead and covers it over, leaving
it there, by way of payment to the plant spirit. After that he takes
them as they come without further ceremony.</p>
<p>The catgut or devil&rsquo;s shoestring (<i lang="la">Tephrosia</i>)
is called <i>distai&prime;y&#301;</i>, &ldquo;they are tough,&rdquo; in
allusion to its stringy roots, from which Cherokee women prepare a
decoction with which to wash their hair in order to impart to it the
strength and toughness of the plant, while a preparation of the leaves
is used by ballplayers to wash themselves in order to toughen their
limbs. To enable them to spring quickly to their feet if thrown to the
ground, the players bathe their limbs also with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name="pb426">426</a>]</span>a
decoction of the small rush (<i lang="la">Juncus tenuis</i>), which,
they say, always recovers its erect position, no matter how often
trampled down. The white seeds of the viper&rsquo;s bugloss (<i lang=
"la">Echium vulgare</i>) were formerly used in many important
ceremonies of which the purpose was to look into the future, but have
now been superseded by the ordinary glass beads of the traders. The
culver root (<i lang="la">Leptandra</i>) is used in love conjurations,
the omen being taken from the motion of the root when held in the hand.
The campion (<i lang="la">Silene stellata</i>), locally known as
&ldquo;rattlesnake&rsquo;s master,&rdquo; is called
<i>ganidaw&acirc;&prime;sk&#301;</i>, &ldquo;it disjoints
itself,&rdquo; because the dried stalk is said to break off by joints,
beginning at the top. As among the white mountaineers, the juice is
held to be a sovereign remedy for snake bites, and it is even believed
that the deadliest snake will flee from one who carries a small portion
of the root in his mouth.</p>
<p>Almost all varieties of burs, from the Spanish needle up to the
cocklebur and Jimsonweed, are classed together under the generic name
of <i>u&prime;nistil&ucirc;n&prime;ist&#301;</i>, which may be freely
rendered as &ldquo;stickers.&rdquo; From their habit of holding fast to
whatever object they may happen to touch, they are believed to have an
occult power for improving the memory and inducing stability of
character. Very soon after a child is born, one of the smaller species,
preferably the <i lang="la">Lespedeza repens</i>, is beaten up and a
portion is put into a bowl of water taken from a fall or cataract,
where the stream makes a constant noise. This is given to the child to
drink on four successive days, with the intention of making him quick
to learn and retain in memory anything once heard. The noise of the
cataract from which the water is taken is believed to be the voice of
Y&ucirc;&ntilde;w&#301; G&ucirc;nahi&prime;ta, the &ldquo;Long
Man,&rdquo; or river god, teaching lessons which the child may
understand, while the stream itself is revered for its power to seize
and hold anything cast upon its surface. A somewhat similar ceremony is
sometimes used for adults, but in this case the matter is altogether
more difficult, as there are tabus for four or seven days, and the mind
must be kept fixed upon the purpose of the rite throughout the whole
period, while if the subject so far forgets himself as to lose his
temper in that time he will remain of a quarrelsome disposition forever
after.</p>
<p>A flowering vine, known as <i>nuniyu&prime;st&#301;</i>,
&ldquo;potato-like,&rdquo; which grows in cultivated fields, and has a
tuberous root somewhat resembling a potato, is used in hunting
conjurations. The bruised root, from which a milky juice oozes, is
rubbed upon the deer bleat,
<i>a&#699;w&#301;&prime;-ahyeli&prime;sk&#301;</i>, with which the
hunter imitates the bleating of the fawn, under the idea that the doe,
hearing it, will think that her offspring desires to suck, and will
therefore come the sooner. The putty-root (Adam-and-Eve, <i lang=
"la">Aplectrum hiemale</i>), which is of an oily, mucilaginous nature,
is carried by the deer hunter, who, on shooting a deer, puts a small
piece of the chewed root into the wound, expecting as a necessary
result to find the animal unusually fat when skinned. Infants which
seem to pine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name=
"pb427">427</a>]</span>and grow thin are bathed with a decoction of the
same root in order to fatten them. The root of the rare plant known as
Venus&rsquo; flytrap (<i lang="la">Dion&aelig;a</i>), which has the
remarkable property of catching and digesting insects which alight upon
it, is chewed by the fisherman and spit upon the bait that no fish may
escape him, and the plant is tied upon the fish trap for the same
purpose.</p>
<p>The root of a plant called
<i>unatl&ucirc;&ntilde;we&prime;hit&ucirc;</i>, &ldquo;having
spirals,&rdquo; is used in conjurations designed to predispose
strangers in favor of the subject. The priest &ldquo;takes it to
water&rdquo;&mdash;i. e., says certain prayers over it while standing
close to the running stream, then chews a small piece and rubs and
blows it upon the body and arms of the patient, who is supposed to be
about to start upon a journey, or to take part in a council, with the
result that all who meet him or listen to his words are at once pleased
with his manner and appearance, and disposed to give every assistance
to his projects. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428"

<h2 class="main">NOTES AND PARALLELS TO MYTHS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the preparation of the following notes and
parallels the purpose has been to incorporate every Cherokee variant or
pseudomyth obtainable from any source, and to give some explanation of
tribal customs and beliefs touched upon in the myths, particularly
among the Southern tribes. A certain number of parallels have been
incorporated, but it must be obvious that this field is too vast for
treatment within the limits of a single volume. Moreover, in view of
the small number of tribes that have yet been studied, in comparison
with the great number still unstudied, it is very doubtful whether the
time has arrived for any extended treatment of Indian mythology. The
most complete index of parallels that has yet appeared is that
accompanying the splendid collection by Dr Franz Boas, <span lang=
"de">Indianische Sagen von der nordpacifischen K&uuml;ste
Amerikas</span>.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11969src" href=
"#xd25e11969" name="xd25e11969src">1</a> In drawing the line it has
been found necessary to restrict comparisons, excepting in a few
special cases, to the territory of the United States or the immediate
border country, although this compels the omission of several of the
best collections, particularly from the northwest coast and the
interior of British America. Enough has been given to show that our
native tribes had myths of their own without borrowing from other
races, and that these were so widely and constantly disseminated by
trade and travel and interchange of ceremonial over wide areas as to
make the Indian myth system as much a unit in this country as was the
Aryan myth structure in Europe and Asia. Every additional tribal study
may be expected to corroborate this result.</p>
<p>A more special study of Cherokee myths in their connection with the
medical and religious ritual of the tribe is reserved for a future
paper, of which preliminary presentation has been given in the
author&rsquo;s Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees, in the Seventh Annual
Report of the Bureau of Ethnology.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p><span class="sc">Stories and story tellers</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb229" class="pageref">229</a>): <i>Migration legend</i>&mdash;In
Buttrick&rsquo;s Antiquities<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11986src" href=
"#xd25e11986" name="xd25e11986src">2</a> we find some notice of this
migration legend, which, as given by the missionary, is unfortunately
so badly mixed up with the Bible story that it is almost impossible to
isolate the genuine. He starts them under the leadership of their
&ldquo;greatest prophet,&rdquo; W&acirc;s&#301;&mdash;who is simply
Moses&mdash;in search of a far distant country where they may be safe
from their enemies. Who these enemies are, or in what quarter they
live, is not stated. Soon after setting out they come to a great water,
which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name=
"pb429">429</a>]</span>W&acirc;s&#301; strikes with his staff; the
water divides so that they pass through safely, and then rolls back and
prevents pursuit by their enemies. They then enter a wilderness and
come to a mountain, and we are treated to the Bible story of Sinai and
the tables of stone. Here also they receive sacred fire from heaven,
which thereafter they carry with them until the house in which it is
kept is at last destroyed by a hostile invasion. This portion of the
myth seems to be genuine Indian (see notes to <a href="#s111">number
111</a>, &ldquo;The Mounds and the Constant Fire&rdquo;).</p>
<p>In this journey &ldquo;the tribes marched separately and also the
clans. The clans were distinguished by having feathers of different
colors fastened to their ears. They had two great standards, one white
and one red. The white standard was under the control of the priests,
and used for civil purposes; but the red standard was under the
direction of the war priests, for purposes of war and alarm. These were
carried when they journeyed, and the white standard erected in front of
the building above mentioned [the ark or palladium], when they
rested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They cross four rivers in all&mdash;which accords with the Indian
idea of the sacred four&mdash;and sit down at last beyond the fourth,
after having been for many years on the march. &ldquo;Their whole
journey through this wilderness was attended with great distress and
danger. At one time they were beset by the most deadly kind of
serpents, which destroyed a great many of the people, but at length
their leader shot one with an arrow and drove them away. Again, they
were walking along in single file, when the ground cracked open and a
number of people sank down and were destroyed by the earth closing upon
them. At another time they came nigh perishing for water. Their head
men dug with their staves in all the low places, but could find no
water. At length their leader found a most beautiful spring coming out
of a rock.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11998src" href=
"#xd25e11998" name="xd25e11998src">3</a></p>
<p>At one point in this migration, according to a tradition given to
Schoolcraft by Stand Watie, they encountered a large river or other
great body of water, which they crossed upon a bridge made by tying
grapevines together.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12003src" href=
"#xd25e12003" name="xd25e12003src">4</a> This idea of a vine bridge or
ladder occurs also in the traditions of the Iroquois, Mandan, and other
tribes.</p>
<p>Farther on the missionary already quoted says: &ldquo;Shield-eater
once inquired if I ever heard of houses with flat roofs, saying that
his father&rsquo;s great grandfather used to say that once their people
had a great town, with a high wall about it; that on a certain occasion
their enemies broke down a part of this wall; that the houses in this
town had flat roofs&mdash;though, he used to say, this was so long ago
it is not worth talking about now.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12008src" href="#xd25e12008" name="xd25e12008src">5</a></p>
<p><i>Fire of cane splints</i>&mdash;Bartram thus describes the method
as witnessed by him at Attasse (Autossee) among the Creeks about 1775.
The fire which blazed up so mysteriously may have been kept constantly
smoldering below, as described in <a href="#s111">number 111</a>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As their virgils [<i>sic</i>] and manner of conducting their
vespers and mystical fire in this rotunda, are extremely singular, and
altogether different from the customs and usages of any other people, I
shall proceed to describe them. In the first place, the governor or
officer who has the management of this business, with his servants
attending, orders the black drink to be brewed, which is a decoction or
infusion of the leaves and tender shoots of the cassine. This is done
under an open shed or pavilion, at twenty or thirty yards distance,
directly opposite the door of the council-house. Next he orders bundles
of dry canes to be brought in: these are previously split and broken in
pieces to about the length of two feet, and then placed obliquely
crossways upon one another on the floor, forming a spiral circle round
about the great centre pillar, rising to a foot or eighteen inches in
height from the ground; and this circle spreading as it proceeds round
and round, often repeated from right to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb430" href="#pb430" name="pb430">430</a>]</span>left, every
revolution increases its diameter, and at length extends to the
distance of ten or twelve feet from the centre, more or less, according
to the length of time the assembly or meeting is to continue. By the
time these preparations are accomplished, it is night, and the assembly
have taken their seats in order. The exterior or outer end of the
spiral circle takes fire and immediately rises into a bright flame (but
how this is effected I did not plainly apprehend; I saw no person set
fire to it; there might have been fire left on the earth; however I
neither saw nor smelt fire or smoke until the blaze instantly ascended
upwards), which gradually and slowly creeps round the centre pillar,
with the course of the sun, feeding on the dry canes, and affords a
cheerful, gentle and sufficient light until the circle is consumed,
when the council breaks up.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12025src"
href="#xd25e12025" name="xd25e12025src">6</a></p>
<p><a href="#s1">1.</a> <span class="sc">How the world was made</span>
(p. <a href="#s1" class="pageref">239</a>): From decay of the old
tradition and admixture of Bible ideas the Cherokee genesis myth is too
far broken down to be recovered excepting in disjointed fragments. The
completeness of the destruction may be judged by studying the similar
myth of the Iroquois or the Ojibwa. What is here preserved was obtained
chiefly from Swimmer and John Ax, the two most competent authorities of
the eastern band. The evergreen story is from
Ta&prime;gw&#259;dih&#301;&prime;. The incident of the brother striking
his sister with a fish to make her pregnant was given by Ay&acirc;sta,
and may have a phallic meaning. John Ax says the pregnancy was brought
about by the &ldquo;Little People,&rdquo; Yu&ntilde;w&#301;
Tsunsdi&prime;, who commanded the woman to rub spittle (of the
brother?) upon her back, and to lie upon her breast, with her body
completely covered, for seven days and nights, at the end of which
period the child was born, and another thereafter every seven days
until the period was made longer. According to Wafford the first man
was created blind and remained so for some time. The incident of the
buzzard shaping the mountains occurs also in the genesis myth of the
Creeks<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12038src" href="#xd25e12038" name=
"xd25e12038src">7</a> and Yuchi,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12041src"
href="#xd25e12041" name="xd25e12041src">8</a> southern neighbors of the
Cherokee, but by them the first earth is said to have been brought up
from under the water by the crawfish. Among the northern tribes it is
commonly the turtle which continues to support the earth upon its back.
The water beetle referred to is the <i>Gyrinus</i>, locally known as
mellow bug or apple beetle. One variant makes the
<i>dilsta&prime;ya&#699;t&#301;</i>, water-spider
(&ldquo;scissors,&rdquo; <i>Dolomedes</i>), help in the work. Nothing
is said as to whence the sun is obtained. By some tribes it is believed
to be a gaming wheel stolen from a race of superior beings. See also
<a href="#s7">number 7</a>, &ldquo;The Journey to the
Sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The missionaries Buttrick and Washburn give versions of the Cherokee
genesis, both of which are so badly warped by Bible interpretation as
to be worthless. No native cosmogonic myth yet recorded goes back to
the first act of creation, but all start out with a world and living
creatures already in existence, though not in their final form and
condition.</p>
<p><i>Hand-breadth</i>&mdash;The Cherokee word is
<i>utaw&acirc;&prime;hil&ucirc;</i>, from <i>uw&acirc;y&#301;</i>,
hand. This is not to be taken literally, but is a figurative expression
much used in the sacred formulas to denote a serial interval of space.
The idea of successive removals of the sun, in order to modify the
excessive heat, is found with other tribes. Buttrick, already quoted,
says in his statement of the Cherokee cosmogony: &ldquo;When God
created the world he made a heaven or firmament about as high as the
tops of the mountains, but this was too warm. He then created a second,
which was also too warm. He thus proceeded till he had created seven
heavens and in the seventh fixed His abode. During some of their
prayers they raise their hands to the first, second, third, fourth,
fifth, sixth and seventh heaven,&rdquo; etc.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12073src" href="#xd25e12073" name="xd25e12073src">9</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Hindu cosmogony also we find seven heavens or stages, increasing
in sanctity as they ascend; the Aztecs had nine, as had also the
ancient Scandinavians.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12079src" href=
"#xd25e12079" name="xd25e12079src">10</a> Some Polynesian tribes have
ten, each built of azure stone, with apertures for intercommunication.
The lowest originally almost touched the earth and was elevated to its
present position by successive pushes from the gods Ru and Matti,
resting first prostrate upon the ground, then upon their knees, then
lifting with their shoulders, their hands, and their finger tips, until
a last supreme effort sent it to its present place.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e12082src" href="#xd25e12082" name="xd25e12082src">11</a></p>
<p><i>Seven: The sacred numbers</i>&mdash;In every tribe and cult
throughout the world we find sacred numbers. Christianity and the
Christian world have three and seven. The Indian has always four as the
principal sacred number, with usually another only slightly
subordinated. The two sacred numbers of the Cherokee are four and
seven, the latter being the actual number of the tribal clans, the
formulistic number of upper worlds or heavens, and the ceremonial
number of paragraphs or repetitions in the principal formulas. Thus in
the prayers for long life the priest raises his client by successive
stages to the first, second, third, fourth, and finally to the seventh
heaven before the end is accomplished. The sacred four has direct
relation to the four cardinal points, while seven, besides these,
includes also &ldquo;above,&rdquo; &ldquo;below,&rdquo; and &ldquo;here
in the center.&rdquo; In many tribal rituals color and sometimes sex
are assigned to each point of direction. In the sacred Cherokee
formulas the spirits of the East, South, West, and North are,
respectively, Red, White, Black, and Blue, and each color has also its
own symbolic meaning of Power (War), Peace, Death, and Defeat.</p>

"#xd25e12099" name="xd25e12099src">12</a> and in the Wahnenauhi

<p>In the version given in the Wahnenauhi manuscript the Possum and the

the hair from his tail, while the other has the feathers scorched from
his head and neck. In another version the Dragon-fly assists the
Water-spider by pushing the tusti from behind. In the corresponding
Creek myth, as given in the Tuggle manuscript, the Rabbit obtains fire
by the stratagem of touching to the blaze a cap trimmed with sticks of
rosin, while pretending to bend low in the dance. In the Jicarilla myth
the Fox steals fire by wrapping cedar bark around his tail and
thrusting it into the blaze while dancing around the circle.<a class=

<p><a href="#s3">3.</a> <span class="sc">Kana&prime;t&#301; and Selu:
Origin of corn and game</span> (p. <a href="#pb242" class=
"pageref">242</a>): This story was obtained in nearly the same form
from Swimmer and John Ax (east) and from Wafford (west), and a version
is also given in the Wahnenauhi manuscript. Hagar notes it briefly in
his manuscript Stellar Legends of the Cherokee. So much of belief and
custom depend upon the myth of Kana&prime;t&#301; that references to
the principal incidents are constant in the songs and formulas. It is
one of those myths held so sacred that in the old days one who wished
to hear it from the priest of the tradition must first purify himself
by &ldquo;going to water,&rdquo; i. e., bathing in the running stream
before daylight when still fasting, while the priest performed his
mystic ceremonies upon the bank.</p>
<p>In his Letters from the Alleghany Mountains, written more than fifty
years ago, Lanman gives (pp. 136, 137) a very fair synopsis of this
myth, locating the game <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href=
"#pb432" name="pb432">432</a>]</span>preserve of Kana&prime;t&#301;,
whom he makes an old Cherokee chief, in a (traditional) cave on the
north side of the Black mountain, now Mount Mitchell, in Yancey county,
North Carolina, the highest peak east of the Rocky mountains. After his
father had disappeared, and could not be found by long search,
&ldquo;The boy fired an arrow towards the north, but it returned and
fell at his feet, and he knew that his father had not travelled in that
direction. He also fired one towards the east and the south and the
west, but they all came back in the same manner. He then thought that
he would fire one directly above his head, and it so happened that this
arrow never returned, and so the boy knew that his father had gone to
the spirit land. The Great Spirit was angry with the Cherokee nation,
and to punish it for the offense of the foolish boy he tore away the
cave from the side of the Black mountain and left only a large cliff in
its place, which is now a conspicuous feature, and he then declared
that the time would come when another race of men should possess the
mountains where the Cherokees had flourished for many
generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story has numerous parallels in Indian myth, so many in fact
that almost every important concept occurring in it is duplicated in
the North, in the South, and on the plains, and will probably be found
also west of the mountains when sufficient material of that region
shall have been collected. The Ojibwa story of &ldquo;The
Weendigoes,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12136src" href=
"#xd25e12136" name="xd25e12136src">15</a> in particular, has many
striking points of resemblance; so, also, the Omaha myth,
&ldquo;Two-faces and the Twin Brothers,&rdquo; as given by
Dorsey.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12139src" href="#xd25e12139" name=
"xd25e12139src">16</a></p>
<p><i>His wife was Selu, &ldquo;Corn&rdquo;</i>&mdash;In Cherokee
belief, as in the mythologies of nearly every eastern tribe, the corn
spirit is a woman, and the plant itself has sprung originally from the
blood drops or the dead body of the Corn Woman. In the Cherokee sacred
formulas the corn is sometimes invoked as Agawe&prime;la, &ldquo;The
Old Woman,&rdquo; and one myth (<a href="#s72">number 72</a>,
&ldquo;The Hunter and Selu&rdquo;) tells how a hunter once witnessed
the transformation of the growing stalk into a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>In the Creek myth &ldquo;Origin of Indian Corn,&rdquo; as given in
the Tuggle manuscript, the corn plant appears to be the transformed
body of an old woman whose only son, endowed with magic powers, has
developed from a single drop of her (menstrual?) blood.</p>
<p>In Iroquois legend, according to Morgan, the corn plant sprang from
the bosom of the mother of the Great Spirit (<i>sic</i>) after her
burial. The spirits of corn, bean, and squash are represented as three
sisters. &ldquo;They are supposed to have the forms of beautiful
females, to be very fond of each other, and to delight to dwell
together. This last belief is illustrated by a natural adaptation of
the plants themselves to grow up together in the same field and perhaps
from the same hill.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12160src" href=
"#xd25e12160" name="xd25e12160src">17</a></p>
<p><i>Sprang from blood</i>&mdash;This concept of a child born of blood
drops reappears in the Cherokee story of Tsul&#699;kal&ucirc;&prime;
(see <a href="#s81">number 81</a>). Its occurrence among the Creeks has
just been noted. It is found also among the Dakota (Dorsey, &ldquo;The
Blood-clots Boy,&rdquo; in Contributions to North American Ethnology,
<span class="sc">IX</span>, 1893), Omaha (Dorsey, &ldquo;The Rabbit and
the Grizzly Bear,&rdquo; Cont. to N. A. Eth., <span class=
"sc">VI</span>, 1890), Blackfeet (&ldquo;Kutoyis,&rdquo; in Grinnell,
&ldquo;Blackfoot Lodge Tales&rdquo;; New York, 1892), and other tribes.
Usually the child thus born is of wilder and more mischievous nature
than is common.</p>
<p><i>Deer shut up in hole</i>&mdash;The Indian belief that the game
animals were originally shut up in a cave, from which they were
afterward released by accident or trickery, is very widespread. In the
Tuggle version of the Creek account of the creation of the earth we
find the deer thus shut up and afterward set free. The Iroquois
&ldquo;believed that the game animals were not always free, but were
enclosed in a cavern <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433"
name="pb433">433</a>]</span>where they had been concealed by
Tawiskara&#700;; but that they might increase and fill the forest
Yoskeh&#259;&#700; gave them freedom.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12182src" href="#xd25e12182" name="xd25e12182src">18</a> The same
idea occurs in the Omaha story of &ldquo;Ictinike, the Brothers and
Sister&rdquo; (Dorsey, in Contributions to North American Ethnology,
<span class="sc">VI</span>, 1890). The Kiowa tell how the buffalo were
kept thus imprisoned by the Crow until released by Sinti when the
people were all starving for want of meat. When the buffalo so suddenly
and completely disappeared from the plains about twenty-five years ago,
the prairie tribes were unable to realize that it had been
exterminated, but for a long time cherished the belief that it had been
again shut up by the superior power of the whites in some underground
prison, from which the spells of their own medicine men would yet bring
it back (see references in the author&rsquo;s Calendar History of the
Kiowa Indians, in Seventeenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, part 1, 1901). The Kiowa tradition is almost exactly
paralleled among the Jicarilla (Russell, Myths of the Jicarilla
Apaches, in Journal of American Folk-Lore, Oct., 1898).</p>
<p><i>Storehouse</i>&mdash;The unwad&acirc;&prime;l&#301;, or
storehouse for corn, beans, dried pumpkins, and other provisions, was a
feature of every Cherokee homestead and was probably common to all the
southern tribes. Lawson thus describes it among the Santee in South
Carolina about the year 1700:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They make themselves cribs after a very curious manner,
wherein they secure their corn from vermin, which are more frequent in
these warm climates than in countries more distant from the sun. These
pretty fabrics are commonly supported with eight feet or posts about
seven feet high from the ground, well daubed within and without upon
laths, with loam or clay, which makes them tight and fit to keep out
the smallest insect, there being a small door at the gable end, which
is made of the same composition and to be removed at pleasure, being no
bigger than that a slender man may creep in at, cementing the door up
with the same earth when they take the corn out of the crib and are
going from home, always finding their granaries in the same posture
they left them&mdash;theft to each other being altogether
unpracticed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12197src" href=
"#xd25e12197" name="xd25e12197src">19</a></p>
<p><i>Rubbed her stomach</i>&mdash;This miraculous procuring of
provisions by rubbing the body occurs also in <a href="#s76">number
76</a>, &ldquo;The Bear Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Knew their thoughts</i>&mdash;Mind reading is a frequent concept
in Indian myth and occurs in more than one Cherokee story.</p>
<p><i>Seven times</i>&mdash;The idea of sacred numbers has already been
noted, and the constant recurrence of seven in the present myth
exemplifies well the importance of that number in Cherokee ritual.</p>
<p><i>A tuft of down</i>&mdash;In the Omaha story, &ldquo;The Corn
Woman and the Buffalo Woman&rdquo; (Dorsey, Contributions to North
American Ethnology, <span class="sc">VI</span>, 1890), the magician
changes himself into a feather and allows himself to be blown about by
the wind in order to accomplish his purpose. The wolf does the same in
a Thompson River myth.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12222src" href=
"#xd25e12222" name="xd25e12222src">20</a> The self-transformation of
the hero into a tuft of bird&rsquo;s down, a feather, a leaf, or some
other light object, which is then carried by the wind wherever he
wishes to go, is very common in Indian myth.</p>
<p><i>Play ball against them</i>&mdash;This is a Cherokee figurative
expression for a contest of any kind, more particularly a battle.</p>
<p><i>Left an open space</i>&mdash;When the Cherokee conjurer, by his
magic spells, coils the great (invisible) serpent around the house of a
sick man to keep off the witches, he is always careful to leave a small
space between the head and tail of the snake, so that the members of
the family can go down to the spring to get water. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name="pb434">434</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Wolves</i>&mdash;The wolf is regarded as the servant and watchdog
of Kana&prime;t&#301;. See <a href="#s15">number 15</a>, &ldquo;The
Fourfooted Tribes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>From these have come all</i>&mdash;In nearly every Indian
mythology we find the idea of certain animal tribes being descended
from a single survivor of some great slaughter by an early hero god or
trickster. Thus the Kiowa say that all the prairie dogs on the plains
are descended from a single little fellow who was too wary to close his
eyes, as his companions did, when the hungry vagrant Sinti was planning
to capture them all for his dinner under pretense of teaching them a
new dance.</p>
<p><i>A gaming wheel</i>&mdash;This was the stone wheel or circular
disk used in the wheel-and-stick game, called by the Cherokee
gatay&ucirc;st&#301;, and which in one form or another was practically
universal among the tribes. It was the game played by the great mythic
gambler &Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime; (see <a href="#s63">number
63</a>). It has sometimes been known in the north as the
&ldquo;snow-snake,&rdquo; while to the early southern traders it was
known as <i>chunki</i> or <i>chungkey</i>, a corruption of the Creek
name. Timberlake (page 77) mentions it under the name of
<i>nettecawaw</i>&mdash;for which there seems to be no other
authority&mdash;as he saw it among the Cherokee in 1762.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e12265src" href="#xd25e12265" name=
"xd25e12265src">21</a> It was also noted among the Carolina tribes by
Lederer in 1670 and Lawson in 1701. John Ax, the oldest man now living
among the East Cherokee, is the only one remaining in the tribe who has
ever played the game, having been instructed in it when a small boy by
an old man who desired to keep up the memory of the ancient things. The
sticks used have long since disappeared, but the stones remain, being
frequently picked up in the plowed fields, especially in the
neighborhood of mounds. The best description of the southern game is
given by Adair:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have near their state house a square piece of ground
well cleaned, and fine sand is carefully strewed over it, when
requisite, to promote a swifter motion to what they throw along the
surface. Only one, or two on a side, play at this ancient game. They
have a stone about two fingers broad at the edge and two spans round.
Each party has a pole of about eight feet long, smooth, and tapering at
each end, the points flat. They set off abreast of each other at 6
yards from the end of the playground; then one of them hurls the stone
on its edge, in as direct a line as he can, a considerable distance
toward the middle of the other end of the square. When they have ran
[<i>sic</i>] a few yards each darts his pole, anointed with
bear&rsquo;s oil, with a proper force, as near as he can guess in
proportion to the motion of the stone, that the end may lie close to
the stone. When this is the case, the person counts two of the game,
and in proportion to the nearness of the poles to the mark, one is
counted, unless by measuring both are found to be at an equal distance
from the stone. In this manner the players will keep running most part
of the day at half speed, under the violent heat of the sun, staking
their silver ornaments, their nose, finger and ear rings; their breast,
arm and wrist plates, and even all their wearing apparel except that
which barely covers their middle. All the American Indians are much
addicted to this game, which to us appears to be a task of stupid
drudgery. It seems, however, to be of early origin, when their
forefathers used diversions as simple as their manners. The hurling
stones they use at present were time immemorial rubbed smooth on the
rocks, and with prodigious labour. They are kept with the strictest
religious care from one generation to another, and are exempted from
being buried with the dead. They belong to the town where they are
used, and are carefully preserved.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12273src" href="#xd25e12273" name="xd25e12273src">22</a></p>
<p>In one version of the Kana&prime;t&#301; myth the wheel is an arrow,
which the wild boy shoots toward the four cardinal points and finally
straight upward, when it comes back no more. When they get above the
sky they find Kana&prime;t&#301; and Selu sitting together, with the
arrow sticking in the ground in front of them. In the Creek story,
&ldquo;The Lion [Panther?] and the Little Girl,&rdquo; of the Tuggle
collection, the lion has a wheel &ldquo;which could find anything that
was lost.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435"
name="pb435">435</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>The twilight land</i>&mdash;Us&ucirc;&ntilde;hi&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Where it is always growing dark,&rdquo; the spirit land in the
west. This is the word constantly used in the sacred formulas to denote
the west, instead of the ordinary word
Wude&prime;lig&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Where it
sets.&rdquo; In the same way N&ucirc;&ntilde;d&acirc;&prime;y&#301;, or
N&ucirc;&ntilde;d&acirc;g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, the &ldquo;Sun
place, or region,&rdquo; is the formulistic name for the east instead
of Dig&#259;l&ucirc;&ntilde;g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Where it [i. e., the sun] comes up,&rdquo; the ordinary term.
These archaic expressions give to myths and formulas a peculiar beauty
which is lost in the translation. As the interpreter once said,
&ldquo;I love to hear these old words.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Struck by lightning</i>&mdash;With the American tribes, as in
Europe, a mysterious potency attaches to the wood of a tree which has
been struck by lightning. The Cherokee conjurers claim to do wonderful
things by means of such wood. Splinters of it are frequently buried in
the field to make the corn grow. It must not be forgotten that the boys
in this myth are Thunder Boys.</p>
<p><i>The end of the world</i>&mdash;See notes to <a href="#s7n">number
7</a>, &ldquo;The Journey to the Sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Anisga&prime;ya Tsunsdi&prime;</i>&mdash;Abbreviated from
Anisga&prime;ya Tsunsdi&prime;ga, &ldquo;Little Men.&rdquo; These two
sons of <span class="corr" id="xd25e12298" title=
"Source: Kana&prime;ti">Kana&prime;t&#301;</span>, who are sometimes
called Thunder Boys and who live <span class="corr" id="xd25e12301"
title="Source: in in">in</span> Us&ucirc;&ntilde;hi&prime;y&#301; above
the sky vault, must not be confounded with the Y&ucirc;&ntilde;w&#301;
Tsunsdi&prime;, or &ldquo;Little People,&rdquo; who are also
Thunderers, but who live in caves of the rocks and cause the short,
sharp claps of thunder. There is also the Great Thunderer, the thunder
of the whirlwind and the hurricane, who seems to be identical with
Kana&prime;t&#301; himself.</p>
<p><i>Deer songs</i>&mdash;The Indian hunters of the olden time had
many songs intended to call up the deer and the bear. Most of these
have perished, but a few are still remembered. They were sung by the
hunter, with some accompanying ceremony, to a sweetly plaintive tune,
either before starting out or on reaching the hunting ground.</p>
<p>One Cherokee deer song; sung with repetition, may be freely
rendered:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">O Deer, you stand close by the tree,</p>
<p class="line">You sweeten your saliva with acorns,</p>
<p class="line">Now you are standing near,</p>
<p class="line">You have come where your food rests on the ground.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Gatschet, in his Creek Migration Legend (<span class=
"sc">I</span>, p. 79), gives the following translation of a Hichitee
deer hunting song:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Somewhere (the deer) lies on the ground, I think; I
walk about.</p>
<p class="line xd25e9869">Awake, arise, stand up!</p>
<p class="line">It is raising up its head, I believe; I walk about.</p>
<p class="line xd25e9869">Awake, arise, stand up!</p>
<p class="line">It attempts to rise, I believe; I walk about.</p>
<p class="line xd25e9869">Awake, arise, stand up!</p>
<p class="line">Slowly it raises its body, I think; I walk about.</p>
<p class="line xd25e9869">Awake, arise, stand up!</p>
<p class="line">It has now risen on its feet, I presume; I walk
about.</p>
<p class="line xd25e9869">Awake, arise, stand up!</p>
</div>
<p class="first"><a href="#s4">4.</a> <span class="sc">Origin of
disease and medicine</span> (p. <a href="#s5" class="pageref">250</a>):
This myth was obtained first from Swimmer, as explaining the theory
upon which is based the medical practice of the Cherokee doctor. It was
afterward heard, with less detail, from John Ax (east) and James
Wafford (west). It was originally published in the author&rsquo;s
Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees, in the Seventh Annual Report of the
Bureau of Ethnology.</p>
<p>In the mythology of most Indian tribes, as well as of primitive
peoples generally, disease is caused by animal spirits, ghosts, or
witchcraft, and the doctor&rsquo;s efforts are directed chiefly to
driving out the malevolent spirit. In Creek belief, according to the
Tuggle manuscript, &ldquo;all disease is caused by the winds, which are
born in the air and then descend to the earth.&rdquo; It is doubtful,
however, if this statement is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436"
href="#pb436" name="pb436">436</a>]</span>intended to apply to more
than a few classes of disease, and another myth in the same collection
recites that &ldquo;once upon a time the beasts, birds, and reptiles
held a council to devise means to destroy the enemy, man.&rdquo; For an
extended discussion of the Indian medical theory, see the
author&rsquo;s paper mentioned above.</p>
<p><i>Animal chiefs and tribes</i>&mdash;For an exposition of the
Cherokee theory of the tribal organization of the animals, with

Creek myth in the Tuggle collection the stripes on the back of the
ground squirrel were made by the bear, who scratched the little fellow
in anger at a council held by the animals to decide upon the proper
division of day and night. Precisely the same explanation is given by
the Iroquois of New York state<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12382src"

<p><a href="#s5">5.</a> <span class="sc">The Daughter of the Sun:
Origin of death</span> (p. <a href="#s5" class="pageref">252</a>): This
is one of the principal myths of the Cherokee, and like most of its
class, has several variants. The sequel has an obvious resemblance to
the myth of Pandora. It was obtained in whole or in part from Swimmer,
John Ax, James Blythe, and others of the eastern band. The version
mainly followed is that of Swimmer, which differs in important details
from that of John Ax.</p>
<p>As told by John Ax, it is the Sun herself, instead of her daughter,
who is killed, the daughter having been assigned the duty of lighting
the earth after the death of her mother, the original Sun. The only
snakes mentioned are the Spreading Adder and the Rattlesnake, the first
being a transformed man, while the other is a stick, upon which the
Little Men cut seven rings before throwing it in the pathway of the
Sun, where it becomes a rattlesnake. The seven rods or staves of the
Swimmer version are with John Ax seven corncobs, which are thrown at
the girl as she passes in the dance (cf. Hagar variant of <a href=
"#s8n">number 8</a> in notes). The Little Men (see <a href="#s3">number
3</a>, &ldquo;Kana&prime;t&#301; and Selu,&rdquo; and other stories)
belong to the John Ax version. The others have only a conjurer or chief
to direct proceedings.</p>
<p>This myth is noted in the Payne manuscript, of date about 1835,
quoted in Squier, Serpent Symbol, page 67: &ldquo;The Cherokees state
that a number of beings were engaged in the creation. The Sun was made
first. The intention of the creators was that men should live always.
But the Sun, when he passed over, told them that there was not land
enough and that people had better die. At length the daughter of the
Sun, who was with them, was bitten by a snake and died. The Sun, on his
return, inquired for her and was told that she was dead. He then
consented that human beings might live always, and told them to take a
box and go where the spirit of his daughter was and bring it back to
her body, charging them that when they got her spirit they should not
open the box until they had arrived where her body was. However,
impelled by curiosity, they opened it, contrary to the injunction of
the Sun, and the spirit escaped; and then the fate of all men was
decided, that they must die.&rdquo; This is copied without credit by
Foster, Sequoyah, page 241.</p>
<p>Another version is thus given by the missionary Buttrick, who died
in 1847, in his Antiquities of the Cherokee Indians, page 3:
&ldquo;Soon after the creation one of the family was bitten by a
serpent and died. All possible means were resorted to to bring back
life, but in vain. Being overcome in this first instance, the whole
race was doomed to follow, not only to death, but to misery afterwards,
as it was supposed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437"
name="pb437">437</a>]</span>that that person went to misery. Another
tradition says that soon after the creation a young woman was bitten by
a serpent and died, and her spirit went to a certain place, and the
people were told that if they would get her spirit back to her body
that the body would live again, and they would prevent the general
mortality of the body. Some young men therefore started with a box to
catch the spirit. They went to a place and saw it dancing about, and at
length caught it in the box and shut the lid, so as to confine it, and
started back. But the spirit kept constantly pleading with them to open
the box, so as to afford a little light, but they hurried on until they
arrived near the place where the body was, and then, on account of her
peculiar urgency, they removed the lid a very little, and out flew the
spirit and was gone, and with it all their hopes of
immortality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a variant noted by Hagar the messengers carry four staves and are
seven days traveling to the ghost country. &ldquo;They found her
dancing in the land of spirits. They struck her with the first
&lsquo;stick,&rsquo; it produced no effect&mdash;with the second, and
she ceased to dance&mdash;with the third, and she looked
around&mdash;with the fourth, and she came to them. They made a box and
placed her in it.&rdquo; He was told by one informant: &ldquo;Only one
man ever returned from the land of souls. He went there in a dream
after a snake had struck him in the forehead. He, Turkey-head, came
back seven days after and described it all. The dead go eastward at
first, then westward to the Land of Twilight. It is in the west in the
sky, but not amongst the stars&rdquo; (Stellar Legends of the Cherokee,
MS, 1898).</p>
<p>In a Shawano myth a girl dies, and, after grieving long for her, her
brother sets out to bring her back from the land of shadows. He travels
west until he reaches the place where the earth and sky meet; then he
goes through and climbs up on the other side until he comes to the
house of a great beneficent spirit, who is designated, according to the
Indian system of respect, as grandfather. On learning his errand this
helper gives him &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; by which he will be able to
enter the spirit world, and instructs him how and in what direction to
proceed to find his sister. &ldquo;He said she would be at a dance, and
when she rose to join in the movement he must seize and ensconce her in

sister, and returns to the house of his instructor, who transforms both
into material beings again, and, after giving them sacred rituals to

<p>In an Algonquian myth of New Brunswick a bereaved father seeks his
son&rsquo;s soul in the spirit domain of Papkootpawut, the Indian
Pluto, who gives it to him in the shape of a nut, which he is told to
insert in his son&rsquo;s body, when the boy will come to life. He puts
it into a pouch, and returns with the friends who had accompanied him.
Preparations are made for a dance of rejoicing. &ldquo;The father,
wishing to take part in it, gave his son&rsquo;s soul to the keeping of
a squaw who stood by. Being curious to see it, she opened the bag, on
which it escaped at once and took its flight for the realms of

<p><a href="#s6">6.</a> <span class="sc">How they brought back the
tobacco</span> (p. <a href="#s6" class="pageref">254</a>): The first
version of this myth as here given was obtained from Swimmer, and
agrees with that of John Ax, except that for the humming bird the
latter substitutes the <i>wasul&ucirc;</i>, or large red-brown moth,
which flies about the tobacco flower in the evening, and states that it
was selected because it could fly so quietly that it would not be
noticed. The second version was obtained from Wafford, in the Cherokee
Nation west, who heard it from his great-uncle nearly ninety years ago,
and differs so much from the other that it has seemed best to give it
separately. The incident of the tree which grows taller as the man
climbs it has close parallels in the mythology of the Kiowa and other
Western tribes, but has no obvious connection with the story, and is
probably either one of a series of adventures originally belonging to
the trip or else a fragment from some otherwise forgotten myth. It may
be mentioned that Wafford was a man of rather practical character, with
but little interest or memory for stories, being able to fill in
details of but few of the large number which he remembered having heard
when a boy.</p>
<p>In his Letters from the Alleghany Mountains, pages 119&ndash;121,
Lanman gives the story as he obtained it in 1848 from Chief
K&acirc;lah&ucirc; (see p. <a href="#pb173" class="pageref">173</a>),
still well remembered by those who knew him as an authority upon tribal
traditions and ritual. In the K&acirc;lah&ucirc; version the story is
connected with Hickorynut gap, a remarkable pass in the Blue ridge
southeast from Asheville, North Carolina, and a comparison with the
later versions shows clearly how much has been lost in fifty years. The
whole body of Cherokee tradition has probably suffered a proportionate
loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before visiting this remarkable passage through the mountains
[Hickorynut gap], I endeavored to ascertain, from the Cherokees of
Qualla town, its original Indian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439"
href="#pb439" name="pb439">439</a>]</span>name, but without succeeding.
It was my good fortune, however, to obtain a romantic legend connected
therewith. I heard it from the lips of a chief who glories in the two
names of All-bones and Flying-squirrel, and, though he occupied no less
than two hours in telling the story, I will endeavor to give it to my
readers in about five minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a time when the Cherokees were without the famous
<i>tso-lungh</i>, or tobacco weed, with which they had previously been
made acquainted by a wandering stranger from the far east. Having
smoked it in their large stone pipes, they became impatient to obtain
it in abundance. They ascertained that the country where it grew in the
greatest quantities was situated on the big waters, and that the
gateway to that country (a mighty gorge among the mountains) was
perpetually guarded by an immense number of little people or spirits. A
council of the bravest men in the nation was called, and, while they
were discussing the dangers of visiting the unknown country, and
bringing therefrom a large knapsack of the fragrant tobacco, a young
man stepped boldly forward and said that he would undertake the task.
The young warrior departed on his mission and never returned. The
Cherokee nation was now in great tribulation, and another council was
held to decide upon a new measure. At this council a celebrated
magician rose and expressed his willingness to relieve his people of
their difficulties, and informed them that he would visit the tobacco
country and see what he could accomplish. He turned himself into a
mole, and as such made his appearance eastward of the mountains; but
having been pursued by the guardian spirits, he was compelled to return
without any spoil. He next turned himself into a humming-bird, and thus
succeeded, to a very limited extent, in obtaining what he needed. On
returning to his country he found a number of his friends at the point
of death, on account of their intense desire for the fragrant weed;
whereupon he placed some of it in a pipe, and, having blown the smoke
into the nostrils of those who were sick, they all revived and were
quite happy. The magician now took into his head that he would revenge
the loss of the young warrior, and at the same time become the sole
possessor of all the tobacco in the unknown land. He therefore turned
himself into a whirlwind, and in passing through the Hickorynut gorge
he stripped the mountains of their vegetation, and scattered huge rocks
in every part of the narrow valley; whereupon the little people were
all frightened away, and he was the only being in the country eastward
of the mountains. In the bed of a stream he found the bones of the
young warrior, and having brought them to life, and turned himself into
a man again, the twain returned to their own country heavily laden with
tobacco; and ever since that time it has been very abundant throughout
the entire land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Iroquois story of &ldquo;The Lad and the Chestnuts,&rdquo;
the Cherokee myth is paralleled with the substitution of a chestnut
tree guarded by a white heron for the tobacco plant watched by the
dag&ucirc;l&#699;k&ucirc; geese (see Smith, Myths of the Iroquois, in
Second Annual Report Bureau of Ethnology, 1883).</p>
<p><i>Tobacco</i>&mdash;Tobacco, as is well known, is of American
origin and is sacred among nearly all our tribes, having an important
place in almost every deliberative or religious ceremony. The tobacco
of commerce (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) was introduced from the West
Indies. The original tobacco of the Cherokee and other eastern tribes
was the &ldquo;wild tobacco&rdquo; (<i lang="la">Nicotiana
rustica</i>), which they distinguish now as
<i>ts&acirc;l-agay&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;li</i>, &ldquo;old
tobacco.&rdquo; By the Iroquois the same species is called the
&ldquo;real tobacco.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Dag&ucirc;l&#699;k&ucirc; geese<a id="xd25e12555" name=
"xd25e12555"></a></i>&mdash;The dag&ucirc;l&#699;k&ucirc; is the
American white-fronted goose (<i lang="la">Anser albifrons
gambeli</i>). It is said to have been of bluish-white color, and to
have been common in the low country toward the coast, but very rare in
the mountains. About the end of September it goes south, and can be
heard at night flying far overhead and crying <i>dugal&#365;!
dugal&#365;! dugal&#365;</i>! Swimmer had heard them passing over, but
had never seen one. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href="#pb440"

<p id="s7n"><a href="#s7">7.</a> <span class="sc">The journey to the
sunrise</span> (p. <a href="#s7" class="pageref">255</a>): This story,
obtained from John Ax, with additional details by Swimmer and
Wafford<span class="corr" id="xd25e12574" title="Source: .">,</span>
has parallels in many tribes. Swimmer did not know the burial incident,
but said&mdash;evidently a more recent interpolation&mdash;that when
they came near the sunrise they found there a race of black men at
work. It is somewhat remarkable that the story has nothing to say of
the travelers reaching the ocean, as the Cherokee were well aware of
its proximity.</p>
<p><i>What the Sun is like</i>&mdash;According to the Payne manuscript,
already quoted, the Cherokee anciently believed that the world, the
first man and woman, and the sun and moon were all created by a number
of beneficent beings who came down for the purpose from an upper world,
to which they afterward returned, leaving the sun and moon as their
deputies to finish and rule the world thus created. &ldquo;Hence
whenever the believers in this system offer a prayer to their creator,
they mean by the creator rather the Sun and Moon. As to which of these
two was supreme, there seems to have been a wide difference of opinion.
In some of their ancient prayers, they speak of the Sun as male, and
consider, of course, the Moon as female. In others, however, they
invoke the Moon as male and the Sun as female; because, as they say,
the Moon is vigilant and travels by night. But both Sun and Moon, as we
have before said, are adored as the creator&#8202;&hellip;. The
expression, &lsquo;Sun, my creator,&rsquo; occurs frequently in their
ancient prayers. Indeed, the Sun was generally considered the superior
in their devotions&rdquo; (quoted in Squier, Serpent Symbol, p. 68).
Haywood, in 1823, says: &ldquo;The sun they call the day moon or
female, and the night moon the male&rdquo; (Nat. and Aborig. Hist.
Tenn., p. 266). According to Swimmer, there is also a tradition that
the Sun was of cannibal habit, and in human form was once seen killing
and devouring human beings. Sun and Moon are sister and brother. See
<a href="#s8">number 8</a>, &ldquo;The Moon and the
Thunders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indians of Thompson river, British Columbia, say of the sun that
formerly &ldquo;He was a man and a cannibal, killing people on his
travels every day&#8202;&hellip;. He hung up the people whom he had
killed during his day&rsquo;s travel when he reached home, taking down
the bodies of those whom he had hung up the night before and eating
them.&rdquo; He was finally induced to abandon his cannibal habit
(Teit, Thompson River Traditions, p. 53).</p>
<p><i>In the same grave</i>&mdash;This reminds us of the adventure in
the voyage of Sinbad the Sailor, as narrated in the Arabian Nights. The
sacrifice of the wife at her husband&rsquo;s funeral was an ancient
custom in the Orient and in portions of Africa, and still survives in
the Hindu suttee. It may once have had a counterpart in America, but so
far as known to the author the nearest approach to it was found in the
region of the lower Columbia and adjacent northwest coast, where a
slave was frequently buried alive with the corpse.</p>
<p><i>Vault of solid rock</i>&mdash;The sky vault which is constantly
rising and falling at the horizon and crushes those who try to go
beyond occurs in the mythologies of the Iroquois of New York, the Omaha
and the Sioux of the plains, the Tillamook of Oregon, and other widely
separated tribes. The Iroquois concept is given by Hewitt,
&ldquo;Rising and Falling of the Sky,&rdquo; in Iroquois Legends, in
the American Anthropologist for October, 1892. In the Omaha story of
&ldquo;The Chief&rsquo;s Son and the Thunders&rdquo; (Dorsey,
Contributions to North American Ethnology, <span class="sc">VI</span>,
1890), a party of travelers in search of adventures &ldquo;came to the
end of the sky, and the end of the sky was going down into the
ground.&rdquo; They tried to jump across, and all succeeded excepting
one, who failed to clear the distance, and &ldquo;the end of the sky
carried him away under the ground.&rdquo; The others go on behind the
other world and return the same way. In the Tillamook myth six men go
traveling and reach &ldquo;the lightning door, which opened and closed
with great rapidity and force.&rdquo; They get through safely, but one
is caught on the return and has his back cut in half by the descending
sky (Boas, Traditions of the Tillamook Indians, in Journal of American
Folk-Lore, Jan., 1898). See also <a href="#s1">number 1</a>, &ldquo;How
the World was Made&rdquo; and <a href="#s3">number 3</a>,

<p id="s8n"><a href="#s8">8.</a> <span class="sc">The Moon and the
Thunders</span> (p. <a href="#s8" class="pageref">256</a>): The story
of the sun and the moon, as here given, was obtained first from Swimmer
and afterward from other informants. It is noted by Hagar, in his
manuscript Stellar Legends of the Cherokee, one narrator making the
girl blacken her brother&rsquo;s face with seven (charred?) corn cobs
(cf. John Ax&rsquo;s version of <a href="#s5">number 5</a> in notes).
Exactly the same myth is found with the native tribes of Greenland,
Panama, Brazil, and Northern India. Among the Khasias of the Himalaya
mountains &ldquo;the changes of the moon are accounted for by the
theory that this orb, who is a man, monthly falls in love with his
wife&rsquo;s mother, who throws ashes in his face. The sun is
female.&rdquo; On some northern branches of the Amazon &ldquo;the moon
is represented as a maiden who fell in love with her brother and
visited him at night, but who was finally betrayed by his passing his
blackened hand over her face.&rdquo; With the Greenland Eskimo the Sun
and Moon are sister and brother, and were playing in the dark,
&ldquo;when Malina, being teased in a shameful manner by her brother
Anninga, smeared her hands with the soot of the lamp and rubbed them
over the face and hands of her persecutor, that she might recognize him
by daylight. Hence arise the spots in the moon (see Timothy Harley,
Moon Lore, London, 1885, and the story &ldquo;The Sun and the
Moon,&rdquo; in Henry Rink&rsquo;s Tales and Traditions of the Eskimo,
London, 1875). In British Columbia the same incident occurs in the
story of a girl and her lover, who was a dog transformed to the
likeness of a man (Teit, Thompson River Traditions, p. 62). A very
similar myth occurs among the Cheyenne, in which the chief personages
are human, but the offspring of the connection become the Pleiades (A.
L. Kroeber, Cheyenne Tales, in Journal of American Folk-Lore, July,
1900). In nearly all mythologies the Sun and Moon are sister and
brother, the Moon being generally masculine, while the Sun is feminine
(cf. German, Der Mond, Die Sonne).</p>
<p>The myth connecting the moon with the ballplay is from Haywood
(Natural and Aboriginal History of Tennessee, p. 285), apparently on
the authority of Charles Hicks, a mixed-blood chief.</p>
<p><i>Eclipse</i>&mdash;Of the myth of the eclipse monster, which may
be frightened away by all sorts of horrible noises, it is enough to say
that it is universal (see Harley, Moon Lore). The Cherokee name for the
phenomenon is <i>n&ucirc;&ntilde;d&#259;&prime;
wal&acirc;&prime;s&#301; u&prime;gisk&#259;&prime;</i>, &ldquo;the frog
is swallowing the sun or moon.&rdquo; Says Adair (History of the
American Indians p. 65): &ldquo;The first lunar eclipse I saw after I
lived with the Indians was among the Cherokee, An. 1736, and during the
continuance of it their conduct appeared very surprizing to one who had
not seen the like before. They all ran wild, this way and that way,
like lunatics, firing their guns, whooping and hallooing, beating of
kettles, ringing horse bells, and making the most horrid noises that
human beings possibly could. This was the effect of their natural
philosophy and done to assist the suffering moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Sun and moon names</i>&mdash;In probably every tribe both sun and
moon are called by the same name, accompanied by a distinguishing
adjective.</p>
<p><i>The Thunders</i>&mdash;The Cherokee name for Thunder,
Ani&prime;-Hy&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;t&#301;kw&#259;l&acirc;&prime;sk&#301;,
is an animate plural form and signifies literally, &ldquo;The
Thunderers&rdquo; or &ldquo;They who make the Thunder.&rdquo; The great
Thunderers are Kana&prime;t&#301; and his sons (see the story), but
inferior thunder spirits people all the cliffs and mountains, and more
particularly the great waterfalls, such as Tallulah, whose
never-ceasing roar is believed to be the voice of the Thunderers
speaking to such as can understand. A similar conception prevailed
among the Iroquois and the eastern tribes generally. Adair says
(History of the American Indians, p. 65), speaking of the southern
tribes: &ldquo;I have heard them say, when it rained, thundered, and
blew sharp for a considerable time, that the beloved or holy people
were at war above the clouds, and they believe that the war at such
times is moderate or hot in proportion to the noise and violence of the
storm.&rdquo; In Portuguese West Africa also the Thunderers are twin
brothers who quarreled and went, one to the east, the other to the
west, whence each answers the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442"
href="#pb442" name="pb442">442</a>]</span>other whenever a great storm
arises.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12637src" href="#xd25e12637" name=
"xd25e12637src">29</a> Among the plains tribes both thunder and
lightning are caused by a great bird.</p>
<p><i>Rainbow</i>&mdash;The conception of the rainbow as the beautiful
dress of the Thunder god occurs also among the South Sea islanders. In
Mangaia it is the girdle of the god Tangaroa, which he loosens and
allows to hang down until the end reaches to the earth whenever he
wishes to descend (Gill, Myths and Songs of the South Pacific, p. 44).
For some unexplained reason the dread of pointing at the rainbow, on
penalty of having the finger wither or become misshapen, is found among
most of the tribes even to the Pacific coast. The author first heard of
it from a Puyallup boy of Puget sound, Washington.</p>
<p><a href="#s9">9.</a> <span class="sc">What the stars are like</span>
(p. <a href="#pb257" class="pageref">257</a>): This story, told by
Swimmer, embodies the old tribal belief. By a different informant Hagar
was told: &ldquo;Stars are birds. We know this because one once shot
from the sky to the ground, and some Cherokee who looked for it found a
little bird, about the size of a chicken just hatched, where it
fell&rdquo; (MS Stellar Legends of the Cherokee, 1898).</p>
<p>The story closely resembles something heard by Lawson among the
Tuscarora in eastern North Carolina about the year 1700. An Indian
having been killed by lightning, the people were assembled for the
funeral, and the priest made them a long discourse upon the power of
lightning over all men, animals, and plants, save only mice and the
black-gum tree. &ldquo;At last he began to tell the most ridiculous
absurd parcel of lies about lightning that could be; as that an Indian
of that nation had once got lightning in the likeness of a partridge;
that no other lightning could harm him whilst he had that about him;
and that after he had kept it for several years it got away from him,
so that he then became as liable to be struck with lightning as any
other person. There was present at the same time an Indian that had
lived from his youth chiefly in an English house, so I called to him
and told him what a parcel of lies the conjurer told, not doubting but
he thought so as well as I; but I found to the contrary, for he replied
that I was much mistaken, for the old man&mdash;who, I believe, was
upwards of an hundred years old&mdash;did never tell lies; and as for
what he said, it was very true, for he knew it himself to be so.
Thereupon seeing the fellow&rsquo;s ignorance, I talked no more about
it (History of Carolina, page 346).</p>
<p>According to Hagar a certain constellation of seven stars, which he
identifies as the Hyades, is called by the Cherokee &ldquo;The
Arm,&rdquo; on account of its resemblance to a human arm bent at the
elbow, and they say that it is the broken arm of a man who went up to
the sky because, having been thus crippled, he was of no further use
upon earth.</p>
<p>A meteor, and probably also a comet, is called
<i>Atsil&prime;-Tl&ucirc;&ntilde;t&ucirc;&prime;ts&#301;</i>&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fire-panther,&rdquo; the same concept being found among the
Shawano, embodied in the name of their great chief, Tecumtha (see p.
<a href="#pb215" class="pageref">215</a>).</p>
<p><a href="#s10">10.</a> <span class="sc">Origin of the Pleiades and
the pine</span> (p. <a href="#pb258" class="pageref">258</a>): This
myth is well known in the tribe, and was told in nearly the same form
by Swimmer, Ta&prime;gwadih&#301;&prime; and Suyeta. The Feather dance,
also called the Eagle dance, is one of the old favorites, and is the
same as the ancient Calumet dance of the northern tribes. For a
description of the gatay&ucirc;&prime;st&#301; game, see note to
<a href="#s3">number 3</a>, &ldquo;Kana&prime;ti and Selu.&rdquo; In a
variant recorded by Stansbury Hagar (MS Stellar Legends of the
Cherokee) the boys spend their time shooting at cornstalks.</p>
<p>According to Squier (Serpent Symbol, p. 69), probably on the
authority of the Payne manuscript, &ldquo;The Cherokees paid a kind of
veneration to the morning star, and also to the seven stars, with which
they have connected a variety of legends, all of which, no doubt, are
allegorical, although their significance is now unknown.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span></p>
<p>The corresponding Iroquois myth below, as given by Mrs Erminnie
Smith in her Myths of the Iroquois (Second Annual Report of Bureau of
Ethnology, p. 80), is practically the same so far as it goes, and the
myth was probably once common over a wide area in the East:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven little Indian boys were once accustomed to bring at eve
their corn and beans to a little mound, upon the top of which, after
their feast, the sweetest of their singers would sit and sing for his
mates who danced around the mound. On one occasion they resolved on a
more sumptuous feast, and each was to contribute towards a savory soup.
But the parents refused them the needed supplies, and they met for a
feastless dance. Their heads and hearts grew lighter as they flew
around the mound, until suddenly the whole company whirled off into the
air. The inconsolable parents called in vain for them to return, but it
was too late. Higher and higher they arose, whirling around their
singer, until, transformed into bright stars, they took their places in
the firmament, where, as the Pleiades, they are dancing still, the
brightness of the singer having been dimmed, however, on account of his
desire to return to earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an Eskimo tale a hunter was pursued by enemies, and as he ran he
gradually rose from the ground and finally reached the sky, where he
was turned into a star (Kroeber, Tales of the Smith Sound Eskimo, in
Journal of American Folk-Lore). This transformation of human beings
into stars and constellations is one of the most common incidents of
primitive myth.</p>
<p><a href="#s11">11.</a> <span class="sc">The Milky Way</span> (p.
<a href="#pb259" class="pageref">259</a>): This story, in slightly
different forms, is well known among the Cherokee east and west. The
generic word for mill is <i>dista&prime;st&#301;</i>, including also
the self-acting pound-mill or
<i>&ucirc;lskw&ucirc;lte&prime;g&#301;</i>. In the original version the
mill was probably a wooden mortar, such as was commonly used by the
Cherokee and other eastern and southern tribes.</p>
<p>In a variant recorded in the Hagar Cherokee manuscript there are two
hunters, one living in the north and hunting big game, while the other
lives in the south and hunts small game. The former, discovering the
latter&rsquo;s wife grinding corn, seizes her and carries her far away
across the sky to his home in the north. Her dog, after eating what
meal is left, follows the pair across the sky, the meal falling from
his mouth as he runs, making the Milky Way.</p>
<p>With the Kiowa, Cheyenne, and other plains tribes the Milky Way is
the dusty track along which the Buffalo and the Horse once ran a race
across the sky.</p>
<p><a href="#s12">12.</a> <span class="sc">Origin of

myth, as here given, was obtained from Ta&prime;gwadih&#301;&prime;,
who said that all the fruits mentioned were then for the first time
created, and added, &ldquo;So some good came from the quarrel,
anyhow.&rdquo; The Swimmer version has more detail, but seems
overdressed.</p>
<p><a href="#s13">13.</a> <span class="sc">The Great Yellow-jacket:
Origin of fish and frogs</span> (p. <a href="#pb260" class=
"pageref">260</a>): This story, obtained from Swimmer, is well known in
the tribe, and has numerous parallels in other Indian mythologies. In
nearly every tribal genesis we find the primitive world infested by
ferocious monster animals, which are finally destroyed or rendered
harmless, leaving only their descendants, the present diminutive types.
Conspicuous examples are afforded in Matthew&rsquo;s Navaho
Legends<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12732src" href="#xd25e12732" name=
"xd25e12732src">30</a> and in the author&rsquo;s story of the Jicarilla
genesis in the American Anthropologist for July, 1898.</p>
<p>Another version of the Cherokee legend is given by Lanman in his
Letters from the Alleghany Mountains, pages 73&ndash;74:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cherokees relate that there once existed among those
mountains [about Nantahala and Franklin] a very large bird, which
resembled in appearance the green-winged hornet, and this creature was
in the habit of carrying off the younger children of the nation who
happened to wander into the woods. Very many children had mysteriously
disappeared in this manner, and the entire people declared a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=
"pb444">444</a>]</span>warfare against the monster. A variety of means
were employed for his destruction, but without success. In process of
time it was determined that the wise men (or medicine-men) of the
nation should try their skill in the business. They met in council and
agreed that each one should station himself on the summit of a
mountain, and that, when the creature was discovered, the man who made
the discovery should utter a loud halloo, which shout should be taken
up by his neighbor on the next mountain, and so continued to the end of
the line, that all the men might have a shot at the strange bird. This
experiment was tried, and resulted in finding out the hiding place of
the monster, which was a deep cavern on the eastern side of the Blue
ridge and at the fountain-head of the river Too-ge-lah [Tugaloo river,
South Carolina]. On arriving at this place, they found the entrance to
the cavern entirely inaccessible by mortal feet, and they therefore
prayed to the Great Spirit that he would bring out the bird from his
den, and place him within reach of their arms. Their petition was
granted, for a terrible thunder-storm immediately arose, and a stroke
of lightning tore away one half of a large mountain, and the Indians
were successful in slaying their enemy. The Great Spirit was pleased
with the courage manifested by the Cherokees during this dangerous
fight, and, with a view of rewarding the same, he willed it that all
the highest mountains in their land should thereafter be destitute of
trees, so that they might always have an opportunity of watching the
movements of their enemies.</p>
<p>As a sequel to this legend, it may be appropriately mentioned, that
at the head of the Too-ge-lah is to be found one of the most remarkable
curiosities of this mountain-land. It is a granite cliff with a smooth
surface or front, half a mile long, and twelve hundred feet high, and
generally spoken of in this part of the country as the <i>White-side
mountain</i>, or <i>the Devil&rsquo;s court-house</i>. To think of it
is almost enough to make one dizzy, but to see it fills one with awe.
Near the top of one part of this cliff is a small cave, which can be
reached only by passing over a strip of rock about two feet wide. One
man only has ever been known to enter it, and when he performed the
deed he met at the entrance of the cave a large bear, which animal, in
making its escape, slipped off the rock, fell a distance of near a
thousand feet, and was of course killed. When the man saw this, he
became so excited that it was some hours before he could quiet his
nerves sufficiently to retrace his dangerous pathway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cherokee myth has a close parallel in the Iroquois story of the
great mosquito, as published by the Tuscarora traditionist, Cusick, in
1825, and quoted by Schoolcraft, Indian Tribes, <span class=
"sc">V</span>, page 638:</p>
<p>&ldquo;About this time a great musqueto invaded the fort Onondaga;
the musqueto was mischievous to the people, it flew about the fort with
a long stinger, and sucked the blood of a number of lives; the warriors
made several oppositions to expel the monster, but failed; the country
was invaded until the Holder of the Heavens was pleased to visit the
people; while he was visiting the king at the fort Onondaga, the
musqueto made appearance as usual and flew about the fort, the Holder
of the Heavens attacked the monster, it flew so rapidly that he could
hardly keep in sight of it, but after a few days chase the monster
began to fail, he chased on the borders of the great lakes towards the
sun-setting, and round the great country, at last he overtook the
monster and killed it near the salt lake Onondaga, and the blood became
small musquetos.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>U&prime;la&#699;g&ucirc;&prime;</i>&mdash;This is not the name of
any particular species, but signifies a leader, principal, or
colloquially, &ldquo;boss,&rdquo; and in this sense is applied to the
large queen yellow-jacket seen in spring, or to the leader of a working
gang. The insect of the story is described as a monster
yellow-jacket.</p>
<p><a href="#s14">14.</a> <span class="sc">The Deluge</span> (p.
<a href="#pb261" class="pageref">261</a>): This story is given by
Schoolcraft in his Notes on the Iroquois, page 358, as having been
obtained in 1846 from the Cherokee chief, Stand Watie. It was obtained
by the author in nearly the same form in 1890 from James Wafford, of
Indian Territory, who had heard it from his grandmother nearly eighty
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445" name=
"pb445">445</a>]</span>years before. The incident of the dancing
skeletons is not given by Schoolcraft, and seems to indicate a lost
sequel to the story. Haywood (Nat. and Aborig. Hist. Tenn., p. 161)
mentions the Cherokee deluge myth and conjectures that the petroglyphs
at Track Rock gap in Georgia may have some reference to it. The
versions given by the missionaries Buttrick and Washburn are simply the
Bible narrative as told by the Indians. Washburn&rsquo;s informant,
however, accounted for the phenomenon by an upheaval and tilting of the
earth, so that the waters for a time overflowed the inhabited parts
(Reminiscences, pp. 196&ndash;197). In a variant related by Hagar (MS
Stellar Legends of the Cherokee) a star with fiery tail falls from
heaven and becomes a man with long hair, who warns the people of the
coming deluge.</p>
<p>It is not in place here to enter into a discussion of the meaning
and universality of the deluge myth, for an explanation of which the
reader is referred to Bouton&rsquo;s Bible Myths and Bible
Folklore.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12781src" href="#xd25e12781" name=
"xd25e12781src">31</a> Suffice it to say that such a myth appears to
have existed with every people and in every age. Among the American
tribes with which it was found Brinton enumerates the Athapascan,
Algonquian, Iroquois, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Caddo, Natchez, Dakota,
Apache, Navaho, Mandan, Pueblo, Aztec, Mixtec, Zapotec, Tlascalan,
Michoacan, Toltec, Maya, Quiche, Haitian, Darien, Popayan, Muysca,

others.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12784src" href="#xd25e12784"
name="xd25e12784src">32</a> It is found also along the Northwest coast,
was known about Albemarle sound, and, as has been said, was probably
common to all the tribes.</p>
<p>In one Creek version the warning is given by wolves; in another by

<p><a href="#s15">15.</a> <span class="sc">The four-footed
tribes</span> (p. <a href="#pb261" class="pageref">261</a>): <i>No
essential difference</i>&mdash;&ldquo;I have often reflected on the
curious connexion which appears to subsist in the mind of an Indian
between man and the brute creation, and found much matter in it for
curious observation. Although they consider themselves superior to all
other animals and are very proud of that superiority; although they
believe that the beasts of the forest, the birds of the air, and the
fishes of the waters were created by the Almighty Being for the use of
man; yet it seems as if they ascribe the difference between themselves
and the brute kind, and the dominion which they have over them, more to
their superior bodily strength and dexterity than to their immortal
souls. All being endowed by the Creator with the power of volition and
self motion, they view in a manner as a great society of which they are
the head, whom they are appointed, indeed, to govern, but between whom
and themselves intimate ties of connexion and relationship may exist,
or at least did exist in the beginning of time. They are, in fact,
according to their opinions, only the first among equals, the
legitimate hereditary sovereigns of the whole animated race, of which
they are themselves a constituent part. Hence, in their languages,
these inflections of their nouns, which we call <i>genders</i>, are
not, as with us, descriptive of the <i>masculine</i> and
<i>feminine</i> species, but of the <i>animate</i> and <i>inanimate</i>
kinds. Indeed, they go so far as to include trees, and plants within
the first of these descriptions. All animated nature, in whatever
degree, is in their eyes a great whole from which they have not yet
ventured to separate themselves. They do not exclude other animals from
their world of spirits, the place to which they expect to go after
death.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12818src" href="#xd25e12818"
name="xd25e12818src">33</a></p>
<p>According to the Ojibwa the animals formerly had the faculty of
speech, until it was taken from them by Nanibojou as a punishment for
having conspired against the human race.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12823src" href="#xd25e12823" name="xd25e12823src">34</a></p>
<p><i>Animal chiefs and councils</i>&mdash;In Pawnee belief, according
to Grinnell, the animals, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href=
"#pb446" name="pb446">446</a>]</span>or Nahurac, possess miraculous
attributes given them by the great creator, Tirawa. &ldquo;The Pawnees
know of five places where these animals meet to hold council&mdash;five
of these Nahurac lodges.&rdquo; He gives a detailed description of
each. The fourth is a mound-shaped hill, on the top of which is a deep
well or water hole, into which the Pawnee throw offerings. The fifth is
a rock hill in Kansas, known to the whites as Guide rock, and &ldquo;in
the side of the hill there is a great hole where the Nahurac hold
councils.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12832src" href=
"#xd25e12832" name="xd25e12832src">35</a></p>
<p>The same belief is noted by Chatelain in Angola, West Africa:
&ldquo;In African folk tales the animal world, as also the spirit
world, is organized and governed just like the human world. In Angola
the elephant is the supreme king of all animal creation, and the
special chief of the edible tribe of wild animals. Next to him in rank
the lion is special chief of the tribe of ferocious beasts and highest
vassal of the elephant. Chief of the reptile tribe is the python. Chief
of the finny tribe is, in the interior, the <i>di-lenda</i>, the
largest river fish. Chief of the feathery tribe is the <i>kakulu ka
humbi</i>, largest of the eagles. Among the domestic animals the
sceptre belongs to the bull; among the locusts to the one called
<i>di-ngundu</i>. Even the ants and termites have their kings or
queens. Every chief or king has his court, consisting of the
ngolambole, tandala, and other officers, his parliament of
<i>ma-kota</i> and his plebeian subjects, just like any human African
<i>saba</i>&rdquo; (Folk tales of Angola, p. 22).</p>
<p><i>Asking pardon of animals</i>&mdash;For other Cherokee references
see remarks upon the Little Deer, the Wolf, and the Rattlesnake; also
<a href="#s4">number 4</a>, &ldquo;Origin of Disease and
Medicine,&rdquo; and <a href="#s58">number 58</a>, &ldquo;The
Rattlesnake&rsquo;s Vengeance.&rdquo; This custom was doubtless general
among the tribes, as it is thoroughly in consonance with Indian idea.
The trader Henry thus relates a characteristic instance among the
Ojibwa in 1764 on the occasion of his killing a bear near the winter
camp:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bear being dead, all my assistants approached, and all,
but more particularly my old mother (as I was wont to call her), took
his head in their hands, stroking and kissing it several times; begging
a thousand pardons for taking away her life; calling her their relation
and grandmother; and requesting her not to lay the fault upon them,
since it was truly an Englishman that had put her to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ceremony was not of long duration; and if it was I that
killed their grandmother, they were not themselves behind-hand in what
remained to be performed. The skin being taken off, we found the fat in
several places six inches deep. This, being divided into two parts,
loaded two persons; and the flesh parts were as much as four persons
could carry. In all, the carcass must have exceeded five hundred
weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as we reached the lodge, the bear&rsquo;s head was
adorned with all the trinkets in the possession of the family, such as
silver arm-bands and wrist-bands, and belts of wampum; and then laid
upon a scaffold, set up for its reception, within the lodge. Near the
nose was placed a large quantity of tobacco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next morning no sooner appeared, than preparations were
made for a feast to the manes. The lodge was cleaned and swept; and the
head of the bear lifted up, and a new stroud of blanket, which had
never been used before, spread under it. The pipes were now lit; and
Wawatam blew tobacco smoke into the nostrils of the bear, telling me to
do the same, and thus appease the anger of the bear on account of my
having killed her. I endeavored to persuade my benefactor and friendly
adviser, that she no longer had any life, and assured him that I was
under no apprehension from her displeasure; but, the first proposition
obtained no credit, and the second gave but little satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length, the feast being ready, Wawatam commenced a speech,
resembling, in many things, his address to the manes of his relations
and departed companions; but, having this peculiarity, that he here
deplored the necessity under which men <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb447" href="#pb447" name="pb447">447</a>]</span>labored thus to
destroy their <i>friends</i>. He represented, however, that the
misfortune was unavoidable, since without doing so, they could by no
means subsist. The speech ended, we all ate heartily of the
bear&rsquo;s flesh; and even the head itself, after remaining three
days on the scaffold, was put into the kettle.&rdquo;&mdash;Travels,
pp. 143&ndash;145.</p>
<p><i>The Rabbit</i>&mdash;The part played by the Rabbit or Hare and
his symbolic character in Indian myth has been already noted (see
&ldquo;Stories and Story Tellers&rdquo;). In his purely animal
character, as an actor among the fourfooted creatures, the same
attributes of trickery and surpassing sagacity are assigned him in
other parts of the world. In the folktales of Angola, West Africa,
&ldquo;The Hare seems to surpass the fox in shrewdness,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Hare has the swiftness and shrewdness of the Monkey, but he
is never reckless, as the Monkey sometimes appears to be&rdquo;
(Chatelain, Folktales of Angola, pp. 295, 300). In farthest Asia also
&ldquo;The animals, too, have their stories, and in Korea, as in some
other parts of the world, the Rabbit seems to come off best, as a
rule&rdquo; (H. N. Allen, Korean Tales, p. 34; New York and London,
1889).</p>
<p><i>The buffalo</i>&mdash;Timberlake repeatedly remarks upon the
abundance of the buffalo in the Cherokee country of East Tennessee in
1762. On one occasion, while in camp, they heard rapid firing from
their scouts and &ldquo;in less than a minute seventeen or eighteen
buffaloes ran in amongst us, before we discovered them, so that several
of us had like to have been run over, especially the women, who with
some difficulty sheltered themselves behind the trees. Most of the men
fired, but firing at random, one only was killed, tho&rsquo; several
more wounded&rdquo; (Memoirs, p. 101). According to a writer in the
Historical Magazine, volume <span class="sc">VIII</span>, page 71,1864,
the last two wild buffalo known in Ohio were killed in Jackson county
in 1800.</p>
<p><i>The elk</i>&mdash;This animal ranged in eastern Carolina in 1700.
&ldquo;The elk is a monster of the venison sort. His skin is used
almost in the same nature as the buffelo&rsquo;s [<i>sic</i>]&hellip;.
His flesh is not so sweet as the lesser deer&rsquo;s. His hams exceed
in weight all creatures which the new world affords. They will often
resort and feed with the buffelo, delighting in the same range as they
do&rdquo; (Lawson, Carolina, p. 203).</p>
<p><i>Cuts out the hamstring</i>&mdash;No satisfactory reason has been
obtained for this custom, which has been noted for more than a century.
Buttrick says of the Cherokee: &ldquo;The Indians never used to eat a
certain sinew in the thigh&#8202;&hellip;. Some say that if they eat of
the sinew they will have cramp in it on attempting to run. It is said
that once a woman had cramp in that sinew and therefore none must eat
it&rdquo; (Antiquities, p. 12). Says Adair, speaking of the southern
tribes generally: &ldquo;When in the woods the Indians cut a small
piece out of the lower part of the thigh of the deer they kill,
length-ways and pretty deep. Among the great number of venison hams
they bring to our trading houses I do not remember to have observed one
without it&rdquo; (History of the American Indians, pp.
137&ndash;138).</p>
<p><i>White animals sacred</i>&mdash;According to a formula in the
Tuggle manuscript for curing the &ldquo;deer sickness,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;White Deer&rdquo; is chief of his tribe in Creek mythology also.
Peculiar sacredness always attaches, in the Indian mind, to white and
albino animals, partly on account of the symbolic meaning attached to
the color itself and partly by reason of the mystery surrounding the
phenomenon of albinism. Among the Cherokee the chiefs both of the Deer
and of the Bear tribe were white. On the plains the so-called white
buffalo was always sacred. Among the Iroquois, according to Morgan
(League of the Iroquois, p. 210), &ldquo;the white deer, white squirrel
and other chance animals of the albino kind, were regarded as
consecrated to the Great Spirit.&rdquo; One of their most solemn
sacrifices was that of the White Dog.</p>
<p><i>The bear</i>&mdash;A reverence for the bear and a belief that it
is half human is very general among the tribes, and is probably based
in part upon the ability of the animal to stand upright and the
resemblance of its tracks to human footprints. According to Grinnell
(Blackfoot Lodge Tales, p. 260), &ldquo;The Blackfeet believe it to be
part brute and part human, portions of its body, particularly the ribs
and feet, being like those of a man.&rdquo; In a note upon a Navaho
myth Matthews says (Navaho Legends, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb448" href="#pb448" name="pb448">448</a>]</span>p. 249): &ldquo;The
bear is a sacred animal with the Navahoes; for this reason the hero did
not skin the bears or eat their flesh. The old man, being a wizard,
might do both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ojibwa idea has been noted in connection with the ceremony of
asking pardon of the slain animal. A curious illustration of the
reverse side of the picture is given by Heckewelder (Indian Nations, p.
255):</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Delaware hunter once shot a huge bear and broke its
backbone. The animal fell and set up a most plaintive cry, something
like that of the panther when he is hungry. The hunter instead of
giving him another shot, stood up close to him, and addressed him in
these words: &lsquo;Hark ye! bear; you are a coward and no warrior as
you pretend to be. Were you a warrior, you would shew it by your
firmness, and not cry and whimper like an old woman. You know, bear,
that our tribes are at war with each other, and that yours was the
aggressor [probably alluding to a tradition which the Indians have of a
very ferocious kind of bear, called the naked bear, which they say once
existed, but was totally destroyed by their ancestors]&hellip;. You
have found the Indians too powerful for you, and you have gone sneaking
about in the woods, stealing their hogs; perhaps at this time you have
hog&rsquo;s flesh in your belly. Had you conquered me, I would have
borne it with courage and died like a brave warrior; but you, bear, sit
here and cry, and disgrace your tribe by your cowardly conduct.&rsquo;
I was present at the delivery of this curious invective. When the
hunter had despatched the bear, I asked him how he thought that poor
animal could understand what he said to it? &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said he
in answer, &lsquo;the bear understood me very well; did you not observe
how ashamed he looked while I was upbraiding
him?&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The wolf and wolf killer</i>&mdash;Speaking of the Gulf tribes
generally, Adair says: &ldquo;The wolf, indeed, several of them do not
care to meddle with, believing it unlucky to kill them, which is the
sole reason that few of the Indians shoot at that creature, through a
notion of spoiling their guns&rdquo; (History of the American Indians,
p. 16). The author has heard among the East Cherokee an incident of a
man who, while standing one night upon a fish trap, was scented by a
wolf, which came so near that the man was compelled to shoot it. He at
once went home and had the gun exorcised by a conjurer. Wafford, when a
boy in the old Nation, knew a professional wolf killer. It is always
permissible to hire a white man to kill a depredating wolf, as in that
case no guilt attaches to the Indian or his tribe.</p>
<p><a href="#s16">16.</a> <span class="sc">The Rabbit goes duck
hunting</span> (p. <a href="#pb266" class="pageref">266</a>): This
story was heard from Swimmer, John Ax, Suyeta (east), and Wafford
(west). Discussions between animals as to the kind of food eaten are
very common in Indian myth, the method chosen to decide the dispute
being usually quite characteristic. The first incident is paralleled in
a Creek story of the Rabbit and the Lion (Panther?) in the Tuggle
manuscript collection and among the remote Wallawalla of Washington
(see Kane, Wanderings of an Artist among the Indians of North America,
p. 268; London, 1859). In an Omaha myth, Ictinike and the Buzzard, the
latter undertakes to carry the trickster across a stream, but drops him
into a hollow tree, from which he is chopped out by some women whom he
has persuaded that there are raccoons inside (Dorsey, Contributions to
North American Ethnology, VI). In the Iroquois tale, &ldquo;A
Hunter&rsquo;s Adventures,&rdquo; a hunter, endeavoring to trap some
geese in the water, is carried up in the air and falls into a hollow
stump, from which he is released by women (Smith, Myths of the
Iroquois, in Second Annual Report of Bureau of Ethnology). In the Uncle
Remus story, &ldquo;Mr. Rabbit Meets His Match Again,&rdquo; the
Buzzard persuades the Rabbit to get upon his back in order to be
carried across a river, but alights with him upon a tree overhanging
the water and thus compels the Rabbit, by fear of falling, to confess a
piece of trickery.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12929src" href=
"#xd25e12929" name="xd25e12929src">36</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p><a href="#s17">17.</a> <span class="sc">How the Rabbit stole the
Otter&rsquo;s coat</span> (p. <a href="#pb267" class=
"pageref">267</a>): This story is well known in the tribe and was heard
from several informants, both east and west. Nothing is said as to how
the Otter recovered his coat. It has exact parallels in the Creek myths
of the Tuggle collection, in one of which the Rabbit tries to personate
a boy hero by stealing his coat, while in another he plays a trick on
the Lion (Panther) by throwing hot coals over him while asleep, at a
creek which the Rabbit says is called
&ldquo;Throwing-hot-ashes-on-you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#s18">18.</a> <span class="sc">Why the Possum&rsquo;s tail
is bare</span> (p. <a href="#pb269" class="pageref">269</a>): This
story was heard from several informants, east and west. In one variant
the hair clipping was done by the Moth, and in another by the spells of
the Snail, who is represented as a magician. The version here given is
the most common, and agrees best with the Cherokee folklore concerning
the Cricket (see <a href="#s59">number 59</a>, &ldquo;The Smaller
Reptiles, Fishes, and Insects&rdquo;).</p>
<p>In the Creek myth, as given in the Tuggle collection, the Opossum
burned the hair from his tail in trying to put rings upon it like those
of the Raccoon&rsquo;s tail, and grins from chewing a bitter oak ball
which he mistook for a ripened fruit.</p>
<p>The anatomical peculiarities of the opossum, of both sexes, have
occasioned much speculation among the Indians, many of whom believe
that the female produces her young without any help from the male. The
Creeks, according to the Tuggle manuscript, believe that the young are
born in the pouch, from the breathing of the female against it when
curled up, and even Lawson and Timberlake assert that they are born at
the teat, from which they afterward drop off into the pouch.</p>
<p><i>A council and a dance</i>&mdash;In the old days, as to-day among
the remote Western tribes, every great council gathering was made the
occasion of a series of dances, accompanied always by feasting and a
general good time.</p>
<p><a href="#s19">19.</a> <span class="sc">How the Wildcat caught the
Gobbler</span> (p. <a href="#pb269" class="pageref">269</a>): This
story was heard from John Ax and David Blythe (east) and from Wafford
and Boudinot (west). The version given below, doctored to suit the
white man&rsquo;s idea, appears without signature in the Cherokee
Advocate of December 18, 1845:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was once a flock of wild turkeys feeding in a valley.
As they fed they heard a voice singing. They soon discovered that the
musician was a hare, and the burden of his song was that he had a
secret in his breast which he would on no account divulge. The
curiosity of the turkeys was excited, and they entreated the hare to
tell them the secret. This he finally consented to do if they would
procure for him the king&rsquo;s daughter for his wife and go with him
and dance around their enemy. They engaged to do all, and the hare led
them to where a wildcat lay apparently dead. The hare prevailed upon
them to close their eyes as they danced. The wildcat meanwhile silently
arose and killed several of them before the rest found out what a snare
they had been caught in. By this artifice on the part of the wildcat,
seconded by the hare, the former had a sumptuous repast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, with its variants, is one of the most widespread of the animal
myths. The same story told by the Cherokee, identical even to the song,
is given in the Creek collection of Tuggle, with the addition that the
Rabbit&rsquo;s tail is afterward bitten off by the enraged Turkeys. In
another Creek version, evidently a later invention, the Raccoon plays a
similar trick upon the Deer for the benefit of the Panther. The Kiowa
of the southern plains tell how the hungry trickster, Sinti, entices a
number of prairie dogs to come near him, under pretense of teaching
them a new dance, and then kills all but one, while they are dancing
around him, according to instruction, with their eyes shut. With the
Omaha the Rabbit himself captures the Turkeys while they dance around,
with closed eyes, to his singing (Dorsey, &ldquo;The Rabbit and the
Turkeys,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ictinike, the Turkeys, Turtle, and
Elk,&rdquo; in Contributions to North American Ethnology, <span class=
"sc">VI</span>). The same stratagem, with only a change of names,
recurs in another Omaha story, &ldquo;The Raccoon and the Crabs,&rdquo;
of the same collection, and in a Cheyenne story of White-man (A. L.
Kroeber, Cheyenne Tales, in Journal <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb450" href="#pb450" name="pb450">450</a>]</span>of American
Folk-Lore, July, 1900), and in the Jicarilla story of &ldquo;The Fox

October, 1898). The Southern negro version, which lacks the important
song and dance feature, is given by Harris in his story of
&ldquo;Brother Rabbit and Mr Wildcat.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p><a href="#s20">20.</a> <span class="sc">How the Terrapin beat the
Rabbit</span> (p. <a href="#pb270" class="pageref">270</a>): This story
was obtained from John Ax and Suyeta and is well known in the tribe. It
is sometimes told with the Deer instead of the Rabbit as the defeated
runner, and in this form is given by Lanman, who thus localizes it:
&ldquo;The race was to extend from the Black mountain to the summit of
the third pinnacle extending to the eastward&rdquo; (Letters, p.
37).</p>
<p>In the Creek collection of Tuggle the same story is given in two
versions, in one of which the Deer and in the other the Wolf is
defeated by the stratagem of the Terrapin. The Southern negro parallel
is given by Harris (Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings) in the
story, &ldquo;Mr Rabbit Finds His Match at Last.&rdquo; It seems almost
superfluous to call attention to the European folklore version, the
well-known story of the race between the Hare and the Tortoise.</p>
<p><a href="#s21">21.</a> <span class="sc">The Rabbit and the tar
wolf</span> (p. <a href="#pb271" class="pageref">271</a>): This story
was obtained in the Indian Territory from James Wafford, who said he
had repeatedly heard it in boyhood about Valley river, in the old
Nation, from Cherokee who spoke no English.</p>
<p>The second version, from the Cherokee Advocate, December 18, 1845,
is given, together with the story of &ldquo;How the Wildcat caught the
Gobbler,&rdquo; with this introduction:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Indian Fables.</i> Mr William P. Ross: I have recently
stumbled on the following Cherokee fables, and perhaps you may think
them worth inserting in the Advocate for the sake of the curious. I am
told that the Cherokees have a great many fables. If I understand the
following, the intention seems to be to teach cunning and artifice in
war. &AElig;sop.&rdquo; The newspaper paragraph bears the pencil
initials of S[amuel] W[orcester] B[utler].</p>
<p>Other Indian versions are found with the Jicarilla (&ldquo;Fox and
Rabbit,&rdquo; Myths of the Jicarilla, by Frank Russell, in Journal of
American Folk-Lore, October, 1898) and Sioux (S. D. Hinman, cited in
Transactions of the Anthropological Society of Washington, <span class=
"sc">I</span>, p. 103, Washington, 1882). The southern negro variant,
&ldquo;The Wonderful Tar-Baby Story,&rdquo; is the introductory tale in
Harris&rsquo;s Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings. A close parallel
occurs in the West African story of &ldquo;Leopard, Monkey, and
Hare&rdquo; (Chatelain, Folktales of Angola).</p>
<p><a href="#s22">22.</a> <span class="sc">The Rabbit and the Possum

specimen of Indian humor was obtained at different times from Swimmer,
John Ax, Suyeta (east), and Wafford (west), and is well known in the

chief&rsquo;s runner, and according to custom was always well
entertained wherever he went.</p>
<p><a href="#s23">23.</a> <span class="sc">The Rabbit dines the
Bear</span> (p. <a href="#pb273" class="pageref">273</a>): This
favorite story with the Cherokee east and west is another of the animal
myths of wide distribution, being found with almost every tribe from
Maine to the Pacific. Beans and peas in several varieties were
indigenous among the agricultural tribes.</p>
<p>In the Creek version, in the Tuggle manuscript, &ldquo;The Bear
invited the Rabbit to dinner. When he came the Bear called his wife and
said, &lsquo;Have peas for dinner: the Rabbit loves peas.&rsquo;
&lsquo;But there is no grease,&rsquo; said the Bear&rsquo;s wife,
&lsquo;to cook them with.&rsquo; &lsquo;O,&rsquo; said the Bear,
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s no trouble, bring me a knife.&rsquo; So she brought
the knife and the Bear took it and split between his toes, while the
Rabbit looked on in wonder. &lsquo;No grease between my toes! Well, I
know where there is some,&rsquo; so he cut a gash in his side and out,
ran the grease. His wife took it and cooked the peas and they had a
fine dinner and vowed always to be good friends,&rdquo; etc. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451" href="#pb451" name=
"pb451">451</a>]</span>wounded Rabbit is put under the care of the
Buzzard, who winds up by eating his patient.</p>
<p>In the Passamaquoddy version, &ldquo;The Rabbit&rsquo;s Adventure
with Mooin, the Bear,&rdquo; the Bear cuts a slice from his foot and
puts it into the pot. The Rabbit invites the Bear to dinner and
attempts to do the same thing, but comes to grief.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e13048src" href="#xd25e13048" name="xd25e13048src">38</a> In a
Jicarilla myth a somewhat similar incident is related of the Fox
(Coyote?) and the Prairie-dog (Russell, Myths of the Jicarilla, in
Journal of American Folk-Lore, October, 1898). In a British Columbian
myth, nearly the same thing happens when the Coyote undertakes to
return the hospitality of the Black Bear (Teit, Thompson River Indian

<p><a href="#s24">24.</a> <span class="sc">The Rabbit escapes from the

<p><a href="#s25">25.</a> <span class="sc">Flint visits the
Rabbit</span> (p. <a href="#pb274" class="pageref">274</a>): This story
was told in slightly different form by John Ax and Swimmer (east) and
was confirmed by Wafford (west). Although among the Cherokee it has
degenerated to a mere humorous tale for the amusement of a winter
evening, it was originally a principal part of the great cosmogonic
myth common to probably all the Iroquoian and Algonquian tribes, and of
which we find traces also in the mythologies of the Aztec and the Maya.
Among the northern Algonquian tribes &ldquo;the West was typified as a
flint stone, and the twin brother of Michabo, the Great Rabbit. The
feud between them was bitter, and the contest long and
dreadful&#8202;&hellip;. At last Michabo mastered his fellow twin and
broke him into pieces. He scattered the fragments over the
earth&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; Among the Iroquoian tribes, cognate with
the Cherokee, the name is variously <i>T&#259;wiskaro&ntilde;</i>,
<i>T&#259;wiskar&#259;</i>, and sometimes <i>Ohaa</i>, all of which are
names both for flint and for hail or ice. <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e13084" title="Source: T&#259;wiskara">T&#259;wiskar&#259;</span>
is the evil-working god, in perpetual conflict with his twin brother
Yoskeha, the beneficent god, by whom he is finally overpowered, when
the blood that drops from his wounds is changed into flint stones.
Brinton sees in the Great Rabbit and the Flint the opposing forces of
day and night, light and darkness, locally personified as East and
West, while in the twin gods of the Iroquois Hewitt sees the
conflicting agents of heat and cold, summer and winter. Both
conceptions are identical in the final analysis. Hewitt derives the
Iroquois name from a root denoting &ldquo;hail, ice, glass&rdquo;; in
Cherokee we have <i>t&#259;wiskal&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;&#301;</i>,
<i>t&#259;wi&prime;sk&#259;l&#259;</i>, &ldquo;flint,&rdquo;
<i>t&#259;wi&prime;sk&#259;</i>, &ldquo;smooth,&rdquo;
<i>une&prime;st&#259;l&ucirc;&ntilde;</i>, &ldquo;ice.&rdquo; (See
Brinton, American Hero Myths, pp. 48, 56, 61; Hewitt, The Cosmogonic
Gods of the Iroquois, in Proc. Am. Ass. Adv. Sci., <span class=
"sc">XLIV</span>, 1895.)</p>
<p>In one of the Cherokee sacred formulas collected by the author
occurs the expression: &ldquo;The terrible Flint is coming. He has his
paths laid down in this direction. He is shaking the red switches
threateningly. Let us run toward the Sun land.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Siyu&prime;</i>&mdash;This word, abbreviated from
<i>&acirc;siyu&prime;</i>, &ldquo;good,&rdquo; is the regular Cherokee
salutation. With probably all the tribes the common salutation is
simply the word &ldquo;good,&rdquo; and in the sign language of the
plains the gesture conveying that meaning is used in the same way. The
ordinary good-bye is usually some equivalent of &ldquo;I go
now.&rdquo;</p>

horns</span> (p. <a href="#pb275" class="pageref">275</a>): This story
was heard from Swimmer, Suyeta, and others, and is well known in the

<p>In a parallel Pawnee myth, &ldquo;How the Deer Lost His Gall,&rdquo;
the Deer and Antelope wager their galls in a race, which the Antelope
wins, but in sympathy takes off his own dewclaws and gives them to the
Deer. In the Blackfoot variant the Deer and the Antelope run two races.
The first, which is over the prairie, the Antelope wins and takes the
Deer&rsquo;s gall, while in the second, which the Deer stipulates shall
be run through the timber, the Deer wins and takes the Antelope&rsquo;s
dewclaws (Grinnell, Pawnee Hero Tales, pp. 204, 205). <span class=

<p>In a Jicarilla myth the Fox kills a dangerous Bear monster under
pretense of trimming down his legs so that he can run faster (Russell,
Myth of the Jicarilla, in Journal of American Folk-Lore, p. 262,
October, 1898).</p>
<p><a href="#s28">28.</a> <span class="sc">What became of the
Rabbit</span> (p. <a href="#pb277" class="pageref">277</a>): This
version was obtained from Suyeta, who says the Rabbit never went up,
because he was &ldquo;too mean&rdquo; to be with the other animals.
Swimmer, however, says that he did afterward go up to
G&#259;l&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;l&#259;t&#301;. The belief in a large
rabbit still existing beyond a great river may possibly have its origin
in indirect reports of the jack-rabbit west of the Missouri.</p>
<p>The myth has close parallel in the southern negro story of
&ldquo;The Origin of the Ocean&rdquo; (Harris, Nights with Uncle
Remus), in which the Rabbit by a stratagem persuades the Lion to jump
across a creek, when the Rabbit &ldquo;cut de string w&rsquo;at

This story, of which the version here given, from Swimmer and John Ax,
is admittedly imperfect, is known also among the western Cherokee,
having been mentioned by Wafford and others in the Nation, although for
some reason none of them seemed able to fill in the details. A somewhat
similar story was given as belonging to her own tribe by a Catawba
woman married among the East Cherokee. It suggests <a href=
"#s21">number 21</a>, &ldquo;The Rabbit and the tar wolf,&rdquo; and
has numerous parallels.</p>
<p>In the Creek version, in the Tuggle manuscript, the Terrapin
ridicules a woman, who retaliates by crushing his shell with a corn
pestle. He repairs the injury by singing a medicine song, but the scars
remain in the checkered spots on his back. In a variant in the same
collection the ants mend his shell with tar, in return for his fat and
blood. Other parallels are among the Omaha, &ldquo;How the Big Turtle
went on the Warpath&rdquo; (Dorsey, Contributions to North American
Ethnology; <span class="sc">VI</span>, p. 275), and the Cheyenne,
&ldquo;The Turtle, the Grasshopper, and the Skunk&rdquo; (Kroeber,
Cheyenne Tales, in Journal of American Folk-Lore, July, 1900). The myth
is recorded also from west Africa by Chatelain (&ldquo;The Man and the
Turtle,&rdquo; in Folktales of Angola, 1894).</p>
<p><i>Kanahe&prime;na.</i>&mdash;This is a sour corn gruel, the
<i>tamfuli</i> or &ldquo;Tom Fuller&rdquo; of the Creeks, which is a
favorite food preparation among all the southern tribes. A large
earthern jar of kanahe&prime;na, with a wooden spoon upright in it, is
always upon a bench just inside the cabin door, for every visitor to

incident occurs in <a href="#s76">number 76</a>, &ldquo;The Bear
Man.&rdquo; According to one Cherokee myth concerning the noted Track
Rock gap, near Blairsville in upper Georgia, the pictographs in the

once crossed over the gap in a great migration toward the south.</p>

The Wolf and the Dog</span> (p. <a href="#pb280" class=

revenge the injury. See also note to <a href="#s15">number 15</a>,
&ldquo;The Fourfooted Tribes,&rdquo; and <a href="#s3">number 3</a>,
&ldquo;Kana&prime;t&#301; and Selu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a West African tale recorded by Chatelain (Folktales of Angola,
1894) the dog and the jackal are kinsmen, who live together in the bush
until the jackal sends the dog to the village for fire. The dog goes,
enters a house and is fed by a woman, and thereupon concludes to stay
in the village, where there is always food.</p>
<p><a href="#s35">35.</a> <span class="sc">The bird tribes</span> (p.
<a href="#pb280" class="pageref">280</a>): <i>The eagle
killer</i>&mdash;Of the Southern tribes generally Adair says:
&ldquo;They use the feathers of the eagle&rsquo;s tail in certain
friendly and religious dances, but the whole town will contribute, to
the value of 200 deerskins, for killing a large eagle&mdash;the bald
eagle they do not esteem&mdash;and the man also gets an honorable title
for the exploit, as if he had brought in the scalp of an
enemy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13270src" href="#xd25e13270"
name="xd25e13270src">39</a></p>
<p>Timberlake says that the Cherokee held the tail of an eagle in the
greatest esteem, as these tails were sometimes given with the wampum in
their treaties, and none of their warlike ceremonies could be performed
without them (Memoirs, p. 81). The figurative expression, &ldquo;a
snowbird has been killed,&rdquo; used to avoid offending the eagle
tribe, is paralleled in the expression, &ldquo;he has been scratched by
a brier,&rdquo; used by the Cherokee to mean, &ldquo;he has been bitten
by a snake.&rdquo; Professional eagle killers existed among many
tribes, together with a prescribed ceremonial for securing the eagle.
The most common method was probably that described in a note to
<a href="#s98">number 98</a>, &ldquo;Gana&rsquo;s Adventures among the
Cherokee.&rdquo; A detailed account of the Blackfoot method is given by
Grinnell, in his Blackfoot Lodge Tales, pp. 236&ndash;240. The eagle,
being a bird of prey, as well as a sacred bird, was never eaten.</p>
<p>The shifting of responsibility for the killing to a vicarious victim
is a common feature of Indian formulas for obtaining pardon, especially
for offenses against the animal tribe or the spirits of the dead. A
remarkable parallel to the Cherokee prayer, from the Quichua of Peru,
is given by Dr G. A. Dorsey. Having started, with a party of Indian
laborers and a Spanish gentleman who was well acquainted with the
native language, to examine some cave tombs near the ancient city of
Cuzco, they had arrived at the spot and he was about to give the order
to begin operations, when the Indians, removing their blankets and
hats, knelt down and recited in unison in their own language a prayer
to the spirits of the dead, of which the following translation is an
extract:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chiefs, sons of the sun, you and we are brothers, sons of the
great Pachacamac. You only know this, but we know that three persons
exist, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. This is the only
difference between you and us&#8202;&hellip;. Chiefs, sons of the sun,
we have not come to disturb your tranquil sleep in this, your abode. We
come only because we have been compelled by our superiors; toward them
may you direct your vengeance and your curses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then followed sacrifices of coca leaves, aguardiente, and chicha,
after which they called upon the snow-capped mountain to witness their
affection for their ancestors, and were then ready to begin work
(Dorsey, A Ceremony of the Quichuas of Peru, in Journal of American
Folk-Lore, October, 1894).</p>
<p><i>Night birds</i>&mdash;Says Adair of the Southern tribes (History
of the American Indians, p. 130, 1775): &ldquo;They reckon all birds of
prey, and birds of night, to be unclean and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb454" href="#pb454" name=
"pb454">454</a>]</span>unlawful to be eaten.&rdquo; The mixed feeling
of fear and reverence for all night birds is universal among the
Western tribes. Owls particularly are believed to bring prophetic
tidings to the few great conjurers who can interpret their
language.</p>
<p><i>The hawk</i>&mdash;This, being a bird of prey, was never eaten.
The following incident is related by Adair, probably from the
Chickasaw: &ldquo;Not long ago when the Indians were making their
winter&rsquo;s hunt and the old women were without flesh meat at home,
I shot a small fat hawk and desired one of them to take and dress it;
but though I strongly importuned her by way of trial, she as earnestly
refused it for fear of contracting pollution, which she called the
&lsquo;accursed sickness,&rsquo; supposing disease would be the
necessary effect of such an impurity&rdquo; (Hist. Am. Indians, p.
130).</p>
<p><i>Chickadee and titmouse</i>&mdash;Adair speaks of having once
observed a party of Southern Indians &ldquo;to be intimidated at the
voice of a small uncommon bird, when it pitched and chirped on a tree
over their camp&rdquo; (op. cit., p. 26). At a conference with the Six
Nations at Albany in 1775 the Oneida speaker said: &ldquo;We, the Six
Nations, have heard the voice of a bird called Tskleleli
(<i>Ts&#301;k&#301;lil&#301;&prime;</i>?), a news carrier, that came
among us. It has told us that the path at the western connection, by
Fort Stanwix, would be shut up by either one party or the other.&rdquo;
In reply, the commissioners said: &ldquo;We apprehend the bird
Tskleleli has been busy again; he seems to be a mischievous bird and
ought not to be nourished or entertained&rdquo; (New York Colonial
Documents, <span class="sc">VIII</span>, pp. 612, 628, 1857). The bird
name is in the Oneida dialect. Bruyas gives <i>teksereri</i> as the
Mohawk name for the tomtit.</p>
<p><a href="#s36">36.</a> <span class="sc">The ball game of the birds
and animals</span> (p. <a href="#pb286" class="pageref">286</a>): This
is one of the best-known animal stories and was heard with more or less
of detail from John Ax, Swimmer, Suyeta, and A&#699;wani&prime;ta in
the east, and from Wafford in the Territory.</p>
<p>The Creeks and the Seminoles also, as we learn from the Tuggle
manuscript collection, have stories of ball games by the birds against
the fourfooted animals. In one story the bat is rejected by both sides,
but is finally accepted by the fourfooted animals on account of his
having teeth, and enables them to win the victory from the birds.</p>
<p><i>The ballplay</i>&mdash;The ballplay,
<i>a&#699;ne&prime;ts&acirc;</i>, is the great athletic game of the
Cherokee and the Gulf tribes, as well as with those of the St Lawrence
and Great lakes. It need hardly be stated that it is not our own game
of base ball, but rather a variety of tennis, the ball being thrown,
not from the hand, but from a netted racket or pair of rackets. The
goals are two sets of upright poles at either end of the ball ground,
which is always a level grassy bottom beside a small stream. There is
much accompanying ceremonial and conjuration, with a ball dance, in
which the women take part, the night before. It is the same game by
which the hostile tribes gained entrance to the British post at
Mackinaw in 1763, and under the name of lacrosse has become the
national game of Canada. It has also been adopted by the French Creoles
of Louisiana under the name of raquette. In British Columbia it is held
to be the favorite amusement of the people of the underworld (Teit,
Thompson River Traditions, p. 116). In the southern states the numerous
localities bearing the names of &ldquo;Ballplay,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ball
flat,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ball ground,&rdquo; bear witness to the Indian
fondness for the game. Large sums were staked upon it, and there is
even a tradition that a considerable territory in northern Georgia was
won from the Creeks by the Cherokee in a ball game. For an extended
description see the the author&rsquo;s article &ldquo;The Cherokee Ball
Play,&rdquo; in the American Anthropologist for April, 1890.</p>
<p><i>Won the game</i>&mdash;On account of their successful work on
this occasion the Cherokee ballplayer invokes the aid of the bat and
the flying squirrel, and also ties a small piece of the bat&rsquo;s
wing to his ball stick or fastens it to the frame over which the sticks
are hung during the preliminary dance the night before.</p>
<p><i>Gave the martin a gourd</i>&mdash;The black house-martin is a
favorite with the Cherokee, who attract it by fastening hollow gourds
to the tops of long poles set up near their houses so that the birds
may build their nests in them. In South Carolina, as far <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb455" href="#pb455" name="pb455">455</a>]</span>back
as 1700, according to Lawson: &ldquo;The planters put gourds on
standing holes [poles] on purpose for these fowl to build in, because
they are a very warlike bird and beat the crows from the
plantations&rdquo; (History of Carolina, p. 238).</p>

<p><i>Red paint</i>&mdash;Much sacredness attaches, in the Indian mind,
to red paint, the color being symbolic of war, strength, success, and
spirit protection. The word paint, in any Indian language, is generally
understood to mean red paint, unless it is otherwise distinctly noted.
The Indian red paint is usually a soft hematite ore, found in veins of
hard-rock formation, from which it must be dug with much labor and
patience. In the western tribes everyone coming thus to procure paint
makes a prayer beside the rock and hangs a small sacrifice upon a
convenient bush or stick before beginning operations.</p>

wins the race.</p>

<i>wa&#699;huhu&prime;</i> (<i lang="la">Megascops asio</i>, screech

<p>The missionary Washburn tells how, among the Cherokee of Arkansas,
he was once riding along, accompanied by an Indian on foot, when they
discovered a poisonous snake coiled beside the path. &ldquo;I observed
Blanket turned aside to avoid the serpent, but made no signs of attack,
and I requested the interpreter to get down and kill it. He did so, and
I then inquired of Blanket why he did not kill the serpent. He
answered, &lsquo;I never kill snakes and so the snakes never kill me;
but I will tell you about it when you next come to see
me.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; He kept his word soon after by relating as a
personal experience (probably, in fact, an Indian dream) a long story
of having once been conducted by a rattlesnake to an underground
council of the rattlesnake tribe, where he found all the snakes
lamenting over one of their number who had been recently killed by an
Indian, and debating the method of punishment, which was executed a day
or two later by inflicting a fatal bite upon the offender while engaged
in the ballplay (Reminiscences, pp. 208&ndash;212). As told by the
missionary, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb457" href="#pb457" name=
"pb457">457</a>]</span>the story is very much dressed up, but
strikingly resembles <a href="#s58">number 58</a>, &ldquo;The
Rattlesnake&rsquo;s Vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adair, evidently confusing several Cherokee snake myths, speaks of
some reputed gigantic rattlesnakes in the Cherokee mountains, with
beautiful changing colors and great power of fascination, by which they
drew into their jaws any living creature coming within their vision,
and continues: &ldquo;They call them and all of the rattlesnake kind,
kings or chieftains of the snakes, and they allow one such to every
different species of the brute creation. An old trader of Cheeowhee
told me that for the reward of two pieces of stroud cloth he engaged a
couple of young warriors to show him the place of their resort; but the
headmen would not by any means allow it, on account of a superstitious
tradition&mdash;for they fancy the killing of them would expose them to
the danger of being bit by the other inferior species of the serpentine
tribe, who love their chieftains and know by instinct those who
maliciously killed them, as they fight only in their own defense and
that of their young ones, never biting those who do not disturb
them.&rdquo; He mentions also an instance of a Chickasaw priest who,
after having applied to his hands the juice of a certain plant, took up
a rattlesnake without damage and laid it carefully in a hollow tree to
prevent Adair&rsquo;s killing it (History of the American Indians, pp.
237&ndash;238).</p>
<p>Of the Carolina tribes generally, Lawson, in 1701, says: &ldquo;As
for killing of snakes, they avoid it if they lie in their way, because
their opinion is that some of the serpents&rsquo; kindred would kill
some of the savage&rsquo;s relations that should destroy him&rdquo;
(History of Carolina, p. 341).</p>
<p>Bartram says of the Seminoles, about 1775: &ldquo;These people never
kill the rattlesnake or any other serpent, saying, if they do so, the
spirit of the killed snake will excite or influence his living kindred
or relatives to revenge the injury or violence done to him when
alive.&rdquo; He recounts an amusing incident of his own experience
where the Indians sent for him to come and kill a rattlesnake which had
invaded their camp ground, and which they were afraid to disturb. Their
request having been complied with, the Indians then insisted upon
scratching him, according to the Indian custom, in order to let out
some of his superabundant blood and courage, but were finally, with
some difficulty, dissuaded from their purpose. &ldquo;Thus it seemed
that the whole was a ludicrous farce to satisfy their people and
appease the manes of the dead rattlesnake&rdquo; (Travels, pp.
258&ndash;261).</p>
<p>The trader Henry (Travels, pp. 176&ndash;179) narrates a most
interesting instance from among the Ojibwa of Lake Superior in 1764.
While gathering wood near the camp he was startled by a sudden rattle,
and looking down discovered a rattlesnake almost at his feet, with body
coiled and head raised to strike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I no sooner saw the snake, than I hastened to the canoe, in
order to procure my gun; but, the Indians observing what I was doing,
inquired the occasion, and being informed, begged me to desist. At the
same time, they followed me to the spot, with their pipes and
tobacco-pouches in their hands. On returning, I found the snake still
coiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians, on their part, surrounded it, all addressing it
by turns, and calling it their <i>grandfather</i>; but yet keeping at
some distance. During this part of the ceremony, they filled their
pipes; and now each blew the smoke toward the snake, who, as it
appeared to me, really received it with pleasure. In a word, after
remaining coiled, and receiving incense, for the space of half an hour,
it stretched itself along the ground, in visible good humor. Its length
was between four and five feet. Having remained outstretched for some
time, at last it moved slowly away, the Indians following it, and still
addressing it by the title of grandfather, beseeching it to take care
of their families during their absence, and to be pleased to open the
heart of Sir William Johnson [the British Indian agent, whom they were
about to visit], so that he might <i>show them charity</i>, and fill
their canoe with rum. One of the chiefs added a petition, that the
snake would take no notice of the insult which had been offered
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458" name=
"pb458">458</a>]</span>him by the Englishman, who would even have put
him to death, but for the interference of the Indians, to whom it was
hoped he would impute no part of the offence. They further requested,
that he would remain, and inhabit their country, and not return among
the English; that is, go eastward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He adds that the appearance of the rattlesnake so far north was
regarded as an extraordinary omen, and that very little else was spoken
of for the rest of the evening. The next day, while steering across
Lake Huron in their canoe, a terrible storm came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians, beginning to be alarmed, frequently called on
the rattlesnake to come to their assistance. By degrees the waves grew
high; and at 11 o&rsquo;clock it blew a hurricane, and we expected
every moment to be swallowed up. From prayers, the Indians now
proceeded to sacrifices, both alike offered to the god-rattlesnake, or
manito-kinib&#301;c. One of the chiefs took a dog, and after tying its
forelegs together, threw it overboard, at the same time calling on the
snake to preserve us from being drowned, and desiring him to satisfy
his hunger with the carcass of the dog. The snake was unpropitious, and
the wind increased. Another chief sacrificed another dog, with the
addition of some tobacco. In the prayer which accompanied these gifts,
he besought the snake, as before, not to avenge upon the Indians the
insult which he had received from myself, in the conception of a design
to put him to death. He assured the snake, that I was absolutely an
Englishman, and of kin neither to him nor to them. At the conclusion of
this speech, an Indian, who sat near me, observed, that if we were
drowned it would be for my fault alone, and that I ought myself to be
sacrificed, to appease the angry manito, nor was I without
apprehensions, that in case of extremity, this would be my fate; but,
happily for me, the storm at length abated, and we reached the island
safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Delawares also, according to Heckewelder, called the rattlesnake
grandfather and refrained from injuring him. He says: &ldquo;One day,
as I was walking with an elderly Indian on the banks of the Muskingum,
I saw a large rattlesnake lying across the path, which I was going to
kill. The Indian immediately forbade my doing so; &lsquo;for,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;the rattlesnake is grandfather to the Indians, and is
placed here on purpose to guard us, and to give us notice of impending
danger by his rattle, which is the same as if he were to tell us,
&lsquo;<i>look about</i>.&rsquo; &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; added he, &lsquo;if
we were to kill one of those, the others would soon know it, and the
whole race would rise upon us and bite us.&rsquo; I observed to him
that the white people were not afraid of this; for they killed all the
rattlesnakes that they met with. On this he enquired whether any white
man had been bitten by these animals, and of course I answered in the
affirmative. &lsquo;No wonder, then!&rsquo; replied he, &lsquo;you have
to blame yourselves for that. You did as much as declaring war against
them, and you will find them in <i>your</i> country, where they will
not fail to make frequent incursions. They are a very dangerous enemy;
take care you do not irritate them in <i>our</i> country; they and
their grandchildren are on good terms, and neither will hurt the
other.&rsquo; These ancient notions have, however in a great measure
died away with the last generation, and the Indians at present kill
their grandfather, the rattlesnake, without ceremony, whenever they
meet with him&rdquo; (Indian Nations, p. 252).</p>
<p><i>S&#259;likw&acirc;y&#301;</i>&mdash;&ldquo;The old Tuscaroras had
a custom, which they supposed would keep their teeth white and strong
through life. A man caught a snake and held it by its head and tail.
Then he bit it through, all the way from the head to the tail, and this
kept the teeth from decay&rdquo; (W. M. Beauchamp, Iroquois Notes, in
Journal of American Folk-Lore, July, 1892).</p>
<p><i>Send torrents of rain</i>&mdash;The belief in a connection
between the serpent and the rain-gods is well-nigh universal among
primitive peoples, and need only be indicated here.</p>
<p><a href="#s50">50.</a> <span class="sc">The Uktena and the
&Ucirc;l&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301;</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb297" class="pageref">297</a>): The belief in the great Uktena and
the magic power of the &Ucirc;l&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301; is
firmly implanted in the Cherokee breast. The Uktena has its parallel in
the Gitchi-Kenebig or Great Horned Serpent of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb459" href="#pb459" name=
"pb459">459</a>]</span>northern Algonquian tribes, and is somewhat
analogous to the Zemo&#699;gu&prime;ani or Great Horned Alligator of
the Kiowa. Myths of a jewel in the head of a serpent or of a toad are
so common to all Aryan nations as to have become proverbial. Talismanic
and prophetic stones, which are carefully guarded, and to which prayer
and sacrifice are offered, are kept in many tribes (see Dorsey, Teton
Folklore, in American Anthropologist, April, 1889). The name of the
serpent is derived from <i>akta</i>, &ldquo;eye,&rdquo; and may be
rendered &ldquo;strong looker,&rdquo; i.e., &ldquo;keen eyed,&rdquo;
because nothing within the range of its vision can escape discovery.
From the same root is derived <i>akta&prime;t&#301;</i>, &ldquo;to look
into,&rdquo; &ldquo;to examine closely,&rdquo; the Cherokee name for a
field glass or telescope. By the English-speaking Indians the serpent
is sometimes called the diamond rattlesnake. The mythic diamond crest,
when in its proper place upon the snake&rsquo;s head, is called
ulst&#301;tl&ucirc;&prime;, literally, &ldquo;it is on his head,&rdquo;
but when detached and in the hands of the conjurer it becomes the
Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301;, &ldquo;Transparent,&rdquo; the
great talisman of the tribe. On account of its glittering brightness it
is sometimes called Ig&#259;g&ucirc;&prime;t&#301;,
&ldquo;Day-light.&rdquo; Inferior magic crystals are believed to be the
scales from the same serpent, and are sometimes also called
ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301;.</p>
<p>The earliest notice of the Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301;
is given by the young Virginian officer, Timberlake, who was sent upon
a peace mission to the Cherokee in 1762, shortly after the close of
their first war with the whites. He says (Memoirs, pp.
47&ndash;49):</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have many beautiful stones of different colours, many of
which, I am apt to believe, are of great value; but their superstition
has always prevented their disposing of them to the traders, who have
made many attempts to that purpose; but as they use them in their
conjuring ceremonies, they believe their parting with them or bringing
them from home, would prejudice their health or affairs. Among others
there is one in the possession of a conjurer, remarkable for its
brilliancy and beauty, but more so for the extraordinary manner in
which it was found. It grew, if we may credit the Indians, on the head
of a monstrous serpent, whose retreat was, by its brilliancy,
discovered; but a great number of snakes attending him, he being, as I
suppose by his diadem, of a superior rank among the serpents, made it
dangerous to attack him. Many were the attempts made by the Indians,
but all frustrated, till a fellow more bold than the rest, casing
himself in leather, impenetrable to the bite of the serpent or his
guards, and watching a convenient opportunity, surprised and killed
him, tearing his jewel from his head, which the conjurer has kept hid
for many years, in some place unknown to all but two women, who have
been offered large presents to betray it, but steadily refused, lest
some signal judgment or mischance should follow. That such a stone
exists, I believe, having seen many of great beauty; but I cannot think
it would answer all the encomiums the Indians bestow upon it. The
conjurer, I suppose, hatched the account of its discovery; I have
however given it to the reader, as a specimen of an Indian story, many
of which are much more surprising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few years later Adair gives us an account of the serpent and the
stone. According to his statement the uktenas had their home in a deep
valley between the heads of the Tuckasegee and the &ldquo;northern
branch of the lower Cheerake river&rdquo; (i. e., the Little
Tennessee), the valley being the deep defile of Nantahala, where, by
reason of its gloomy and forbidding aspect, Cherokee tradition locates
more than one legendary terror. With pardonable error he confounds the
Uktena with the Chief of the Rattlesnakes. The two, however, are
distinct, the latter being simply the head of the rattlesnake tribe,
without the blazing carbuncle or the immense size attributed to the
Uktena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between two high mountains, nearly covered with old mossy
rocks, lofty cedars and pines, in the valleys of which the beams of the
sun reflect a powerful heat, there are, as the natives affirm, some
bright old inhabitants or rattlesnakes, of a more enormous size than is
mentioned in history. They are so large and unwieldy, that they take a
circle almost as wide as their length to crawl around in their shortest
orbit; but bountiful nature compensates the heavy motion of their
bodies, for, as they say, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb460" href=
"#pb460" name="pb460">460</a>]</span>no living creature moves within
the reach of their sight, but they can draw it to
them&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The description the Indians give us of their colour is as
various as what we are told of the camelion, that seems to the
spectator to change its colour, by every different position he may view
it in; which proceeds from the piercing rays of the light that blaze
from their foreheads, so as to dazzle the eyes, from whatever quarter
they post themselves&mdash;for in each of their heads, there is a large
carbuncle, which not only repels, but they affirm, sullies the meridian
beams of the sun. They reckon it so dangerous to disturb these
creatures, that no temptation can induce them to betray their secret
recess to the prophane. They call them and all of the rattlesnake kind,
kings, or chieftains of the snakes, and they allow one such to every
different species of the brute creation. An old trader of Cheeowhee
told me, that for the reward of two pieces of stroud cloth, he engaged
a couple of young warriors to shew him the place of their resort, but
the head-men would not by any means allow it, on account of a
superstitious tradition&mdash;for they fancy the killing of them would
expose them to the danger of being bit by the other inferior species of
that serpentine tribe, who love their chieftains, and know by instinct
those who maliciously killed them, as they fight only in their own
defence and that of their young ones, never biting those who do not
disturb them.&rdquo;&mdash;History of the American Indians, pp.
237&ndash;238.</p>
<p>In another place (page 87) he tells us of an
ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;t&#301; owned by a medicine-man who resided at
Tymahse (Tomassee), a former Cherokee town on the creek of the same
name near the present Seneca, South Carolina. &ldquo;The above Cheerake
prophet had a carbuncle near as big as an egg, which they said he found
where a great rattlesnake lay dead, and that it sparkled with such
surprising lustre as to illuminate his dark winter house, like strong
flashes of continued lightning, to the great terror of the weak, who
durst not upon any account approach the dreadful fire-darting place,
for fear of sudden death. When he died it was buried along with him,
according to custom, in the town of Tymahse, under the great beloved
cabbin [seat], which stood in the westernmost part of that old fabric,
where they who will run the risk of searching may luckily find
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hagar also mentions the &ldquo;Oolunsade,&rdquo; and says, on the
authority of John Ax: &ldquo;He who owns a crystal can call one of the
Little People to him at any time and make him do his bidding. Sometimes
when people are ill it is because some evil invisible being has taken
possession of him. Then the Little Man called up by the crystal can be
placed on guard near the ill man to prevent the evil spirit from
re-entering after it has been expelled&rdquo; (MS Stellar Legends of
the Cherokee).</p>
<p>The Southern Alleghenies, the old Cherokee country, abound with
crystals of various kinds, as well as with minerals. The
Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301; is described as a triangular
crystal about two inches long, flat on the bottom, and with slightly
convex sides tapering up to a point, and perfectly transparent with the
exception of a single red streak running through the center from top to
bottom. It is evidently a rare and beautiful specimen of rutile quartz,
crystals of which, found in the region, may be seen in the National
Museum at Washington.</p>
<p>Other small stones of various shapes and color are in common use
among the Cherokee conjurers to discover lost articles or for other
occult purposes. These also are frequently called by the same name, and
are said to have been originally the scales of the Uktena, but the
Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301;&mdash;the talisman from the
forehead of the serpent&mdash;is the crystal here described, and is so
exceedingly rare that so far as is known only one remained among the
East Cherokee in 1890. Its owner, a famous hunter, kept it hidden in a
cave, wrapped up in a deerskin, but refused all inducements to show it,
much less to part with it, stating that if he should expose it to the
gaze of a white man he could kill no more game, even were he permitted
to live after such a sacrilege.</p>
<p>The possession of the talisman insures success in hunting, love,
rain making, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb461" href="#pb461"
name="pb461">461</a>]</span>all other undertakings, but its great use
is in life divination, and when it is invoked for this purpose by its
owner the future is mirrored in the transparent crystal as a tree is
reflected in the quiet stream below.</p>
<p>When consulting it the conjurer gazes into the crystal, and after
some little time sees in its transparent depths a picture of the person
or event in question. By the action of the specter, or its position
near the top or bottom of the crystal, he learns not only the event
itself, but also its nearness in time or place.</p>
<p>Many of the East Cherokee who enlisted in the Confederate service
during the late war consulted the
Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301; before starting, and survivors
declare that their experiences verified the prediction. One of these
had gone with two others to consult the fates. The conjurer, placing
the three men facing him, took the talisman upon the end of his
outstretched finger and bade them look intently into it. After some
moments they saw their own images at the bottom of the crystal. The
images gradually ascended along the red line. Those of the other two
men rose to the middle and then again descended, but the presentment of
the one who tells the story continued to ascend until it reached the
top before going down again. The conjurer then said that the other two
would die in the second year of the war, but the third would survive
through hardships and narrow escapes and live to return home. As the
prophecy, so the event.</p>
<p>When consulted by the friends of a sick man to know if he will
recover; the conjurer shows them the image of the sick man lying at the
bottom of the Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301;. He then tells
them to go home and kill some game (or, in these latter days, any food
animal) and to prepare a feast. On the appointed day the conjurer, at
his own home, looks into the crystal and sees there the picture of the
party at dinner. If the image of the sick man rises and joins them at
the feast the patient will recover; if otherwise, he is doomed.</p>

(p. <a href="#pb248" class="pageref">248</a>): This is one of the most
important of the Cherokee traditions, for the reason that it deals with
the mythic monster, the Uktena, and explains the origin of the great

was obtained from Swimmer (east) with additions and variants from
Wafford (west) and others. It is recorded by Ten Kate as obtained by
him in the Territory (Legends of the Cherokees, in Journal of American
Folk-Lore, January, 1889), and is mentioned in connection with the
Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301;, by Adair, in 1775, and by
Timberlake as early as 1762 (see notes to <a href="#s50">number 50</a>,
&ldquo;The Uktena and the

Ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301; a scale from the seventh ring
of the serpent.</p>
<p>The Shawano, who at one time occupied the Cumberland region of
Tennessee immediately adjoining the Cherokee, were regarded as wizards
by all the southern tribes. Brinton says: &ldquo;Among the Algonkins
the Shawnee tribe did more than all others combined to introduce and
carry about religious legends and ceremonies. From the earliest times
they seem to have had peculiar aptitude for the ecstacies, deceits, and
fancies that make up the spiritual life of their associates. Their
constantly roving life brought them in contact with the myths of many
nations, and it is extremely probable that they first brought the tale
of the horned serpent from the Creeks and Cherokees&rdquo; (Myths of
the New World, p. 137).</p>
<p><i>Localities</i>&mdash;Ut&#259;wag&ucirc;n&prime;ta mountain,

Duniskwa&#699;lg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301; gap and
Atag&acirc;&prime;h&#301; (mythic) lake, are all points in the Great
Smoky range, which forms the dividing line between North Carolina and
Tennessee. Tlanusi&prime;y&#301; is the native name for the site of
Murphy, at the junction of Hiwassee and Valley rivers, North Carolina.
Gah&ucirc;&prime;t&#301; is Cohutta mountain in Murray county, Georgia.
According to Wafford there are on the sides of this mountain several
stone inclosures which were built by &Acirc;gan-uni&prime;ts&#301; for
shelter places before attacking the Uktena (see also <a href=

<p><i>Struck by lightning</i>&mdash;As has been explained elsewhere,
the wood of a tree that has been struck by lightning plays an important
part in Cherokee folklore.</p>
<p><i>Strong and dangerous</i>&mdash;It is a common article of Indian
belief that the presence of a powerful talisman, no matter how
beneficent in itself, is enervating or positively dangerous to those in
its vicinity unless they be fortified by some ceremonial tonic. For
this reason every great &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; is usually kept apart in
a hut or tipi built for the purpose, very much as we are accustomed to
store explosives at some distance from the dwelling or business
house.</p>
<p><a href="#s53">53.</a> <span class="sc">The Hunter and the
Uksu&prime;h&#301;</span> (p. <a href="#s53" class="pageref">301</a>):
This story was told by Swimmer and John Ax as an actual fact. The
uksu&prime;h&#301; is the mountain blacksnake or black racer (<i lang=
"la">Coluber obsoletus</i>). The name seems to refer to some
peculiarity of the eye, <i>akt&#259;</i> (cf. uktena). Hickory-log,
properly Wane&prime;as&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;tl&ucirc;&ntilde;yi,
&ldquo;Hickory footlog,&rdquo; was a Cherokee settlement on Hiwassee
river, near the present Hayesville, Clay county, North Carolina.
Another of the same name was on Etowah river in Georgia.</p>

<p><i>&Acirc;s&#301;</i>&mdash;The Cherokee &acirc;s&#301;, or
&ldquo;hot-house,&rdquo; as it was called by the old traders, is the
equivalent of the sweat-house of the western tribes. It is a small hut
of logs plastered over with clay, with a shed roof, and just tall
enough to permit a sitting or reclining, but not a standing, position
inside. It is used for sweat-bath purposes, and as it is tight and
warm, and a fire is usually kept smoldering within, it is a favorite
sleeping place for the old people in cold weather. It is now nearly
obsolete.</p>
<p><a href="#s57">57.</a> <span class="sc">The Snake Man</span> (p.
<a href="#s57" class="pageref">304</a>): This myth, obtained from Chief
Smith, seems designed to impress upon the laity the importance of a
strict observance of the innumerable gakt&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;ta, or
tabus, which beset the daily life of the Cherokee, whether in health or
sickness, hunting, war, or arts of peace (see the author&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees,&rdquo; in the Seventh Annual
Report of the Bureau of Ethnology).</p>
<p>Similar transformation myths are found all over the world. One of
the most ancient is the story of Cadmus, in Ovid&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Metamorphoses,&rdquo; with the despair of the wife as she sees
the snaky change come over her husband. &ldquo;Cadmus, what means this?
Where are thy feet? Where are both thy shoulders and thy hands? Where
is thy color? and, while I speak, where all else besides?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a Pawnee story given by Grinnell two brothers, traveling, camp
for the night. The elder eats some tabued food, and wakes from his
sleep to find that he is changing into a great rattlesnake, the change
beginning at his feet. He rouses his brother and gives him his last
instructions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I have changed into a snake, take me in your arms and
carry me over to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb463" href="#pb463"
name="pb463">463</a>]</span>that hole. That will be my home, for that
is the house of the snakes.&rdquo; Having still a man&rsquo;s mind, he
continues to talk as the metamorphosis extends upward, until at last
his head changes to that of a snake, when his brother takes him up and
carries him to the hole. The relatives make frequent visits to the
place to visit the snake, who always comes out when they call, and the
brother brings it a share of his war trophies, including a horse and a
woman, and receives in return the protection of the snake man (Pawnee
Hero Stories, pp. 171&ndash;181). A close Omaha variant is given by
Dorsey (&ldquo;The warriors who were changed to snakes,&rdquo; in
Contributions to North American Ethnology, <span class=

<p><a href="#s58">58.</a> <span class="sc">The Rattlesnake&rsquo;s

<i>Gi&prime;g&#259;-tsuha&prime;&#699;l&#301;</i>&mdash;This lizard is
probably the <i lang="la">Pleistodon erythrocephalus</i>, which is
described in Holbrook&rsquo;s &ldquo;Herpetology&rdquo; as being about
11 to 13 inches long, with bright red head, olive-brown body and tail,
and yellowish-white throat and abdomen. &ldquo;The <i>Pleistodon
erythrocephalus</i> chooses his residence in deep forests, and is
commonly found about hollow trees, often at a height of 30 or 40 feet
from the ground, sometimes taking up his abode in the last year&rsquo;s
nest of the woodpecker, out of which he thrusts his bright red head in
a threatening manner to those who would disturb his home. He never
makes his habitation on or near the ground, and in fact seldom descends
from his elevation unless in search of food or water. Though shy and
timid, he is very fierce when taken, and bites severely, owing to the
great strength of his jaws, as well as the size and firmness of the
teeth. The bite, however, though sharp and painful, is not, as is
commonly supposed, venomous.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e13835src" href="#xd25e13835" name="xd25e13835src">40</a></p>
<p><i>Large horned beetle</i>&mdash;This beetle, variously called by
the Cherokee crawfish, deer or buck, on account of its branching horns,
is probably the &ldquo;flying stag&rdquo; of early travelers. Says
Timberlake: &ldquo;Of insects, the flying stag is almost the only one
worthy of notice. It is about the shape of a beetle, but has very
large, beautiful, branching horns, like those of a stag, from whence it
took its name&rdquo; (Memoirs p. 46). Lawson, about 1700, also mentions
&ldquo;the flying stags, with horns,&rdquo; among the insects of
eastern Carolina.</p>

which makes a very fair imitation of a bullfrog&rsquo;s note. The other
stories were told by Ts&#277;sa&prime;ni (Jessan) and confirmed by
Swimmer.</p>
<p>In a Creek variant of the first story, in the Tuggle collection, it
is a pretty girl, who is obdurate until her lover, the Rabbit, conceals
himself in the same way near the spring, with a blowgun for a trumpet,
and frightens her into consent by singing out: &ldquo;The girl who

and John Ax (east), and confirmed also by James Wafford (west), who
remembered, however, only the main points of the pursuit and final
capture at K&acirc;g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;. The two versions
corresponded very closely, excepting that Ax sends the boy to the
Sunset land to play against his brothers, while Swimmer brings them to
meet him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb464" href="#pb464" name=
"pb464">464</a>]</span>at their father&rsquo;s house. In the Ax
version, also, the gambler flees directly to the west, and as often as
the brothers shoot at him with their arrows the thunder rolls and the
lightning flashes, but he escapes by sinking into the earth, which
opens for him, to reappear in another form somewhere else. Swimmer
makes the Little People help in the chase. In Cherokee figure an
invitation to a ball contest is a challenge to battle. Thunder is
always personified in the plural,
Ani&prime;-Hy&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;tikw&#259;l&acirc;&prime;sk&#301;,
&ldquo;The Thunderers.&rdquo; The father and the two older sons seem to
be Kana&prime;t&#301; and the Thunder Boys (see <a href="#s3">number
3</a>, &ldquo;Kana&prime;t&#301; and Selu&rdquo;), although neither
informant would positively assert this, while the boy hero, who has no
other name, is said to be the lightning. Nothing is told of his after
career.</p>
<p><i>&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime;</i>&mdash;In this name
(sometimes E&prime;tsaiy&#301;&prime; or Tsaiy&#301;&prime;) the first
syllable is almost silent and the vowels are prolonged to imitate the
ringing sound produced by striking a thin sheet of metal. The word is
now translated &ldquo;brass,&rdquo; and is applied to any object made
of that metal. The mythic gambler, who has his counterpart in the
mythologies of many tribes, is the traditional inventor of the
wheel-and-stick game, so popular among the southern and eastern
Indians, and variously known as gatay&ucirc;st&#301;, chenco, or
ch&ucirc;nki (see note under <a href="#s3">number 3</a>,
&ldquo;Kana&prime;t&#301; and Selu&rdquo;). He lived on the south side
of Tennessee river, at &Ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;tiguh&#301;&prime;.</p>
<p><i>&Ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;tiguh&#301;&prime; or The
Suck</i>&mdash;The noted and dangerous rapid known to the whites as
&ldquo;The Suck&rdquo; and to the Cherokee as
&Ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;tiguh&#301;&prime;, &ldquo;Pot in the
water,&rdquo; is in Tennessee river, near the entrance of Suck creek,
about 8 miles below Chattanooga, at a point where the river gathers its
whole force into a contracted channel to break through the Cumberland
mountain. The popular name, Whirl, or Suck, dates back at least to
1780, the upper portion being known at the same time as &ldquo;The
boiling pot&rdquo; (Donelson diary, in Ramsey, Tennessee, p.
71),<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13904src" href="#xd25e13904" name=
"xd25e13904src">41</a> a close paraphrase of the Indian name. In the
days of pioneer settlement it was a most dangerous menace to
navigation, but some of the most serious obstacles in the channel have
now been removed by blasting and other means. The Cherokee name and
legend were probably suggested by the appearance of the rapids at the
spot. Close to where &Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime; lived, according
to the Indian account, may still be seen the large flat rock upon which
he was accustomed to play the gatay&ucirc;st&#301; game with all who
accepted his challenge, the lines and grooves worn by the rolling of
the wheels being still plainly marked, and the stone wheels themselves
now firmly attached to the surface of the rock. A similarly grooved or
striped rock, where also, it is said, &Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime;
used to roll his wheel, is reported to be on the north side of
Hiwassee, just below Calhoun, Tennessee.</p>
<p>The Suck is thus described by a traveler in 1818, while the whole
was still Indian country and Chattanooga was yet undreamed of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here, I cannot forbear pausing a moment to call your
attention to the grand and picturesque scenery which opens to the view
of the admiring spectator. The country is still possessed by the
aborigines, and the hand of civilization has done but little to soften
the wild aspect of nature. The Tennessee river, having concentrated
into one mass the numerous streams it has received in its course of
three or four hundred miles, glides through an extended valley with a
rapid and overwhelming current, half a mile in width. At this place, a
group of mountains stand ready to dispute its progress. First, the
&lsquo;Lookout,&rsquo; an independent range, commencing thirty miles
below, presents, opposite the river&rsquo;s course, its bold and rocky
termination of two thousand feet. Around its brow is a pallisade
[<i>sic</i>] of naked rocks, from seventy to one hundred feet. The
river flows upon its base, and instantly twines to the right. Passing
on for six miles farther it turns again, and is met by the side of the
Rackoon mountain. Collecting its strength into a channel of seventy
yards, it severs the mountain, and rushes tumultuously through the
rocky defile, wafting the trembling navigator at the rate of a mile in
two or three minutes. The passage is called &lsquo;The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb465" href="#pb465" name=
"pb465">465</a>]</span>Suck.&rsquo; The summit of the Lookout mountain
overlooks the whole country. And to those who can be delighted with the
view of an interminable forest, penetrated by the windings of a bold
river, interspersed with hundreds of verdant prairies, and broken by
many ridges and mountains, furnishes in the month of May, a landscape,
which yields to few others, in extent, variety or
beauty.&rdquo;&mdash;Rev. Elias Cornelius, in (Silliman&rsquo;s)
American Journal of Science, <span class="sc">I</span>, p. 223,
1818.</p>
<p><i>Bet even his life</i>&mdash;The Indian was a passionate gambler
and there was absolutely no limit to the risks which he was willing to
take, even to the loss of liberty, if not of life. Says Lawson (History
of Carolina, p. 287): &ldquo;They game very much and often strip one
another of all they have in the world; and what is more, I have known
several of them play themselves away, so that they have remained the
winners&rsquo; servants till their relations or themselves could pay
the money to redeem them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>His skin was clean</i>&mdash;The idea of purification or
cleansing through the efficacy of the sweat-bath is very common in
Indian myth and ceremonial. In an Omaha story given by Dorsey the hero
has been transformed, by witchcraft, into a mangy dog. He builds a
sweat lodge, goes into it as a dog and sweats himself until, on his
command, the people take off the blankets, when &ldquo;Behold, he was
not a dog; he was a very handsome man&rdquo; (&ldquo;Adventures of
Hingpe-agce,&rdquo; in Contributions to North American Ethnology, VI,
p. 175).</p>
<p><i>From the bottom</i>&mdash;The choice of the most remote or the
most insignificant appearing of several objects, as being really the
most valuable, is another common incident in the myths.</p>
<p><i>Honey-locust tree</i>&mdash;The favorite honey-locust tree and
the seat with thorns of the same species in the home of the Thunder Man
may indicate that in Indian as in Aryan thought there was an occult
connection between the pinnated leaves and the lightning, as we know to
be the case with regard to the European rowan or mountain ash.</p>
<p><i>All kinds of snakes</i>&mdash;It will be remembered that the
boy&rsquo;s father was a thunder god. The connection between the snake
and the rain or thunder spirit has already been noted. It appears also
in <a href="#s84">number 84</a>, &ldquo;The Man who Married the
Thunder&rsquo;s Sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Elder brother</i>&mdash;My elder brother (male speaking),
<i>&ucirc;&ntilde;gini&prime;l&#301;</i>; my elder brother (female
speaking), <i>&ucirc;&ntilde;gid&#259;&prime;</i>; thy two elder
brothers (male speaking), <i>tsets&#259;ni&prime;l&#301;</i>.</p>
<p><i>Sunset land</i>&mdash;The Cherokee word here used is
<i>Wus&ucirc;hih&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</i>, &ldquo;there where
they stay over night.&rdquo; The usual expression in the sacred formula
is <i>us&ucirc;&ntilde;hi&prime;y&#301;</i>, &ldquo;the darkening, or
twilight place&rdquo;; the common word is
<i>wude&prime;lig&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</i>, &ldquo;there where
it (the sun) goes down.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lightning at every stroke</i>&mdash;In the Omaha myth of
&ldquo;The Chief&rsquo;s Son and the Thunders,&rdquo; given by Dorsey,
some young men traveling to the end of the world meet a Thunder Man,
who bids the leader <span class="corr" id="xd25e13973" title=
"Not in source">to</span> select one of four medicine bags. Having been
warned in advance, he selects the oldest, but most powerful, and is
then given also a club which causes thunder whenever flourished in the
air (Contributions to North American Ethnology, <span class=
"sc">VI</span>, p. 185).</p>
<p><i>Strike the rock</i>&mdash;This method of procuring water is as
old at least as the book of Exodus.</p>
<p><i>The brass rubbed off</i>&mdash;The beautiful metallic luster on
the head of <i>Phan&aelig;us carnifex</i> is thus accounted for. The
common roller beetle is called &ldquo;dung roller,&rdquo; but this
species is distinguished as the &ldquo;horned, brass&rdquo; beetle. It
is also sometimes spoken of as the dog of the Thunder Boys.</p>
<p><i>Beavers gnaw at the grapevine</i>&mdash;Something like this is
found among the Cheyenne: &ldquo;The earth rests on a large beam or
post. Far in the north there is a beaver as white as snow who is a
great father of all mankind. Some day he will gnaw through the support
at the bottom. We shall be helpless and the earth will fall. This will
happen when he becomes angry. The post is already partly eaten through.
For <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb466" href="#pb466" name=
"pb466">466</a>]</span>this reason one band of the Cheyenne never eat
beaver or even touch the skin. If they do touch it, they become
sick&rdquo; (Kroeber, Cheyenne Tales, in Journal of American Folk-Lore,
July, 1900).</p>
<p><a href="#s64">64.</a> <span class="sc">The nest of the
Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;</span> (p. <a href="#s64" class=
"pageref">315</a>): This story was obtained first from John Ax and
Ta&prime;gwadihi&prime;, and was afterward heard of frequently in
connection with the cave at Citico. It is mentioned by Ten Kate in
&ldquo;Legends of the Cherokees,&rdquo; obtained in the Indian
Territory, in the Journal of American Folk-Lore, January, 1889.</p>
<p><i>Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;</i>&mdash;The Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;
(Ts&#259;&prime;nuw&#259; or S&ucirc;&prime;n&#259;w&#259; in the
Middle dialect) is a mythic bird, described as a great hawk, larger
than any bird now existing. There is a small hawk called
tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259; usdi&prime;, &ldquo;little
tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;,&rdquo; which is described as its smaller
counterpart or image, and which the Cherokee say accompanies flocks of
wild pigeons, occasionally when hungry swooping down and killing one by
striking it with its sharp breast bone. It is probably the goshawk
(<i lang="la">Astur atricapillus</i>). The great
Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;, like the other animals, &ldquo;went
up.&rdquo; According to Adair (History of the American Indians, p. 17)
the Cherokee used to compare a miserly person to a
&ldquo;sinnawah.&rdquo; When John Ax first recited the story he
insisted that the whites must also believe it, as they had it pictured
on their money, and holding up a silver coin, he triumphantly pointed
out what he claimed was the figure of the Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;,
holding in its talons the arrows and in its beak the serpent. He was
not so far wrong, as it is well known that the Mexican coat of arms,
stamped upon the coins of the republic, has its origin in a similar
legend handed down from the Aztec. Myths of dangerous monster serpents
destroyed by great birds were common to a number of tribes. The
Tuscarora, formerly eastern neighbors of the Cherokee, told &ldquo;a
long tale of a great rattlesnake, which, a great while ago, lived by a
creek in that river, which was Neus, and that it killed abundance of
Indians; but at last a bald eagle killed it, and they were rid of a
serpent that used to devour whole canoes full of Indians at a
time&rdquo; (Lawson, Carolina, p. 346).</p>
<p>
<i>Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;&prime;&#301;</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;
place,&rdquo; the cliff so called by the Cherokee, with the cave half
way up its face, is on the north bank of Little Tennessee river, a
short distance below the entrance of the Citico creek, on land formerly
belonging to Colonel John Lowrey, one of the Cherokee officers at the
battle of the Horseshoe bend (Wafford). Just above, but on the opposite
side of the river, is U&#699;tl&ucirc;&ntilde;ti&prime;y&#301;, the
former haunt of the cannibal liver eater (see <a href="#s66">number
66</a>, &ldquo;U&#699;tl&ucirc;&ntilde;ta, the
Spear-finger&rdquo;).</p>
<p><i>Soon after the creation</i>&mdash;As John Ax put it, adopting the
Bible expression, <i>H&#301;lahi&prime;yu dine&prime;tl&#259;n&#259;
a&prime;nigwa</i>&mdash;&ldquo;A long time ago the creation soon
after.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Rope of linn bark</i>&mdash;The old Cherokee still do most of
their tying and packing with ropes twisted from the inner bark of
trees. In one version of the story the medicine-man uses a long
ud&acirc;&prime;&#301; or cohosh (<i>Act&aelig;a</i>?) vine.</p>
<p><i>Holes are still there</i>&mdash;The place which the Cherokee call
Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;-a&prime;tsiyel&ucirc;&ntilde;is&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Where the Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259; cut it up,&rdquo; is nearly
opposite Citico, on Little Tennessee river, just below Talassee ford,
in Blount county, Tennessee. The surface of the rock bears a series of
long trenchlike depressions, extending some distance, which, according
to the Indians, are the marks where the pieces bitten from the body of
the great serpent were dropt by the Tl&#259;&prime;nuw&#259;.</p>

Cherokees,&rdquo; in the Journal of American Folk-Lore for January,
1889, as obtained from a mixed-blood informant in Tahlequah. Another
version, &ldquo;The Demon of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb467" href=
"#pb467" name="pb467">467</a>]</span>Consumption,&rdquo; by Capt. James
W. Terrell, formerly a trader among the East Cherokee, appears in the
same journal for April, 1892. Still another variant, apparently
condensed from Terrell&rsquo;s information, is given by Zeigler and
Grosscup, &ldquo;Heart of the Alleghanies,&rdquo; page 24 (Raleigh and
Cleveland, 1883). In Ten Kate&rsquo;s version the stone coat of mail
broke in pieces as soon as the monster was killed, and the fragments
were gathered up and kept as amulets by the people.</p>
<p>There is some confusion between this story of
U&#699;tl&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;ta and that of
N&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;yunu&prime;w&#301; (<a href="#s67">number
67</a>). According to some myth tellers the two monsters were husband
and wife and lived together, and were both alike dressed in stone, had
awl fingers and ate human livers, the only difference being that the
husband waylaid hunters, while his female partner gave her attention to
children.</p>
<p>This story has a close parallel in the Creek myth of the Tuggle
collection, &ldquo;The Big Rock Man,&rdquo; in which the people finally
kill the stony monster by acting upon the advice of the Rabbit to shoot
him in the ear.</p>
<p>Far away, in British Columbia, the Indians tell how the Coyote
transformed himself to an Elk, covering his body with a hard shell.
&ldquo;Now this shell was like an armor, for no arrow could pierce it;
but being hardly large enough to cover all his body, there was a small
hole left underneath his throat.&rdquo; He attacks the people, stabbing
them with his antlers and trampling them under foot, while their arrows
glance harmlessly from his body, until <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e14070" title="Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>the Meadow-lark, who
was a great telltale, appeared and cried out, &lsquo;There is just a
little hole at his throat!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; A hunter directs his
arrow to that spot and the Elk falls dead (Teit, Thompson River
Traditions, pp. 33&ndash;34).</p>
<p><i>U&#699;tl&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;ta</i>&mdash;The word means
literally &ldquo;he (or she) has it sharp,&rdquo; i. e., has some sharp
part or organ. It might be used of a tooth or finger nail or some other
attached portion of the body, but here refers to the awl-like finger.
Ten Kate spells the name Uilata. On Little Tennessee river, nearly
opposite the entrance of Citico creek, in Blount county, Tennessee, is
a place which the Cherokee call
U&#699;tl&ucirc;&ntilde;t&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Sharp-finger place,&rdquo; because, they say,
U&#699;tl&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;ta used to frequent the spot.</p>
<p>
<i>N&ucirc;&ntilde;y&ucirc;&prime;-tlu&#699;g&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;&#301;</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Tree
rock,&rdquo; so called on account of its resemblance to a standing tree
trunk; a notable monument-shape rock on the west side of Hiwassee
river, about four miles above Hayesville, North Carolina, and nearly on
the Georgia line.</p>
<p><i>Whiteside mountain</i>&mdash;This noted mountain, known to the
Cherokee as Sanigil&acirc;&prime;g&#301;, a name for which they have no
meaning, is one of the prominent peaks of the Blue ridge, and is
situated southeast from Franklin and about four miles from Highlands,
or the dividing line between Macon and Jackson counties, North
Carolina. It is 4,900 feet high, being the loftiest elevation on the
ridge which forms the watershed between the tributaries of the Little
Tennessee and the Chattooga branch of Savannah. It takes its name from
the perpendicular cliff on its western exposure, and is also known
sometimes as the Devil&rsquo;s courthouse. The Indians compare the
appearance of the cliff to that of a sheet of ice, and say that the
western summit was formerly crowned by a projecting rock, since
destroyed by lightning, which formed a part of the great bridge which
U&#699;tl&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;ta attempted to build across the valley.
Lanman&rsquo;s description of this mountain, in 1848, has been quoted
in the notes to <a href="#s13">number 13</a>, &ldquo;The Great
Yellow-jacket.&rdquo; Following is a notice by a later writer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;About five miles from Highlands is that huge old cliff,
Whitesides, which forms the advanced guard of all the mountain ranges
trending on the south. It is no higher than the Righi, but, like it,
rising direct from the plain, it overpowers the spectator more than its
loftier brethren. Through all the lowlands of upper Georgia and Alabama
this dazzling white pillar of rock, uplifting the sky, is an emphatic
and significant landmark. The ascent can be made on horseback, on the
rear side of the mountain, to within a quarter of a mile of the summit.
When the top is reached, after a short stretch of nearly perpendicular
climbing, the traveler finds himself on <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb468" href="#pb468" name="pb468">468</a>]</span>the edge of a sheer
white wall of rock, over which, clinging for life to a protecting hand,
he can look, if he chooses, two thousand feet down into the dim valley
below. A pebble dropped from his hand will fall straight as into a
well. On the vast plain below he can see the wavelike hills on which
the great mountain ranges which have stretched from Maine along the
continent ebb down finally into the southern
plains&rdquo;&mdash;Rebecca H. Davis, Bypaths in the Mountains, in
Harper&rsquo;s Magazine, <span class="sc">LXI</span>, p. 544,
September, 1880.</p>
<p><i>Picking strawberries</i>&mdash;For more than a hundred years, as
readers of Bartram will remember, the rich bottom lands of the old
Cherokee country have been noted for their abundance of strawberries
and other wild fruits.</p>
<p><i>My grandchildren</i>&mdash;As in most Indian languages, Cherokee
kinship terms are usually specialized, and there is no single term for
grandchild. &ldquo;My son&rsquo;s child&rdquo; is
<i>&ucirc;&ntilde;gini&prime;s&#301;</i>, plural
<i>ts&ucirc;&ntilde;gini&prime;s&#301;</i>; &ldquo;my daughter&rsquo;s
child&rdquo; is <i>&ucirc;&ntilde;gili&prime;s&#301;</i>, plural
<i>ts&ucirc;&ntilde;gili&prime;s&#301;</i>. The use of kinship terms as
expressive of affection or respect is very common among Indians.</p>
<p><i>Taking the appearance</i>&mdash;This corresponds closely with the
European folk-belief in fairy changelings.</p>
<p><i>To burn the leaves</i>&mdash;The burning of the fallen leaves in
the autumn, in order to get at the nuts upon the ground below, is still
practiced by the white mountaineers of the southern Alleghenies. The
line of fire slowly creeping up the mountain side upon a dark night is
one of the picturesque sights of that picturesque country.</p>
<p><i>The song</i>&mdash;As rendered by Swimmer, the songs seem to be
intended for an imitation of the mournful notes of some bird, such as
the turtle dove, hidden in the deep forests.</p>
<p><i>Pitfall</i>&mdash;The pitfall trap for large game was known among
nearly all the tribes, but seems not to have been in frequent use.</p>
<p><i>Chickadee and tomtit</i>&mdash;These two little birds closely
resemble each other, the Carolina chickadee (<i>Parus carolinensis</i>)
or ts&#301;k&#301;lil&#301; being somewhat smaller than the tufted
titmouse (<i>Parus bicolor</i>) or utsu&#699;g&#301;, which is also
distinguished by a topknot or crest. The belief that the
ts&#301;k&#301;lil&#301; foretells the arrival of an absent friend is
general among the Cherokee, and has even extended to their neighbors,
the white mountaineers. See also <a href="#s35">number 35</a>,
&ldquo;The Bird Tribes,&rdquo; and accompanying notes.</p>
<p><i>Her heart</i>&mdash;The conception of a giant or other monster
whose heart or &ldquo;life&rdquo; is in some unaccustomed part of the
body, or may even be taken out and laid aside at will, so that it is
impossible to kill the monster by ordinary means, is common in Indian
as well as in European and Asiatic folklore.</p>
<p>In a Navaho myth we are told that the Coyote &ldquo;did not, like
other beings, keep his vital principle in his chest, where it might
easily be destroyed. He kept it in the tip of his nose and in the end
of his tail, where no one would expect to find it.&rdquo; He meets
several accidents, any one of which would be sufficient to kill an
ordinary creature, but as his nose and tail remain intact he is each
time resurrected. Finally a girl whom he wishes to marry beats him into
small pieces with a club, grinds the pieces to powder, and scatters the
powder to the four winds. &ldquo;But again she neglected to crush the
point of the nose and the tip of the tail,&rdquo; with the result that
the Coyote again comes to life, when of course they are married and
live happily until the next chapter (Matthews, Navaho Legends, pp.
91&ndash;94).</p>
<p>In a tale of the Gaelic highlands the giant&rsquo;s life is in an
egg which he keeps concealed in a distant place, and not until the hero
finds and crushes the egg does the giant die. The monster or hero with
but one vulnerable spot, as was the case with Achilles, is also a
common concept.</p>
<p><a href="#s67">67.</a> <span class=
"sc">N&ucirc;&ntilde;yunu&prime;w&#301;, the Stone Man</span> (p.
<a href="#pb319" class="pageref">319</a>): This myth, although obtained
from Swimmer, the best informant in the eastern band, is but
fragmentary, for the reason that he confounded it with the somewhat
similar story of U&#699;tl&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;ta (<a href=
"#s66">number 66</a>). It was mentioned by Ay&acirc;sta and others
(east) and by Wafford (west) as a very old <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb469" href="#pb469" name="pb469">469</a>]</span>and
interesting story, although none of these could recall the details in
connected form. It is noted as one of the stories heard in the
Territory by Ten Kate (Legends of the Cherokees, in Journal of American
Folk-Lore, January, 1889), who spells the name Nayunu&prime;wi.</p>
<p><i>N&ucirc;&ntilde;yunu&prime;w&#301;</i>, &ldquo;Dressed in
stone&rdquo;; <i>ad&acirc;&prime;lan&ucirc;&ntilde;st&#301;</i>, a
staff or cane; <i>as&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;tl&#301;</i>,
<i>as&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;tl&ucirc;&ntilde;&#301;</i>, a foot log or
bridge; <i>ada&prime;weh&#301;</i>, a great magician or supernatural
wonder-worker; see the <a href="#gloss">glossary</a>.</p>
<p>A very close parallel is found among the Iroquois, who have
traditions of an invasion by a race of fierce cannibals known as the
Stonish Giants, who, originally like ordinary humans, had wandered off
into the wilderness, where they became addicted to eating raw flesh and
wallowing in the sand until their bodies grew to gigantic size and were
covered with hard scales like stone, which no arrow could penetrate
(see Cusick, in Schoolcraft, Indian Tribes, V, p. 637). One of these,
which preyed particularly upon the Onondaga, was at last taken in a
pitfall and thus killed. Another, in tracking his victims used
&ldquo;something which looked like a finger, but was really a pointer
made of bone. With this he could find anything he wished.&rdquo; The
pointer was finally snatched from him by a hunter, on which the giant,
unable to find his way without it, begged piteously for its return,
promising to eat no more men and to send the hunter long life and good
luck for himself and all his friends. The hunter thereupon restored it
and the giant kept his promises (Beauchamp, W. M., Iroquois Notes, in
Journal of American Folk-Lore, Boston, July, 1892.) As told by Mrs
Smith (&ldquo;The Stone Giant&rsquo;s Challenge,&rdquo; Myths of the
Iroquois, in Second Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1883),
the pointer was a human finger. &ldquo;He placed it upright upon his
hand, and it immediately pointed the way for him to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Menstrual woman</i>&mdash;Among all our native tribes it is
believed that there is something dangerous or uncanny in the touch or
presence of a menstrual woman. Hence the universal institution of the
&ldquo;menstrual lodge,&rdquo; to which the woman retires at such
periods, eating, working, and sleeping alone, together with a host of
tabus and precautions bearing upon the same subject. Nearly the same
ideas are held in regard to a pregnant woman.</p>
<p><i>Sourwood stakes</i>&mdash;Cherokee hunters impale meat upon
sourwood (<i>Oxydendrum</i>) stakes for roasting, and the wood is
believed, also, to have power against the spells of witches.</p>
<p><i>Began to talk</i>&mdash;The revealing of &ldquo;medicine&rdquo;
secrets by a magician when in his final agony is a common incident in
Indian myths.</p>
<p><i>Whatever he prayed for</i>&mdash;Swimmer gives a detailed
statement of the particular petition made by several of those thus
painted. Painting the face and body, especially with red paint, is
always among Indians a more or less sacred performance, usually
accompanied with prayers.</p>
<p><a href="#s68">68.</a> <span class="sc">The hunter in the
D&#259;kw&#259;&prime;</span>&mdash;This story was told by Swimmer and
Ta&prime;gwadih&#301;&prime; and is well known in the tribe. The
version from the Wahnenauhi manuscript differs considerably from that
here given. In the Bible translation the word d&#259;kw&#259;&prime; is
used as the equivalent of whale. Haywood thus alludes to the story
(Nat. and Aborig. Hist. Tenn., p. 244): &ldquo;One of the ancient
traditions of the Cherokees is that once a whale swallowed a little
boy, and after some time spewed him upon the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is pretty certain that the Cherokee formerly had some
acquaintance with whales, which, about the year 1700, according to
Lawson, were &ldquo;very numerous&rdquo; on the coast of North
Carolina, being frequently stranded along the shore, so that settlers
derived considerable profit from the oil and blubber. He enumerates
four species there known, and adds a general statement that &ldquo;some
Indians in America&rdquo; hunted them at sea (History of Carolina, pp.
251&ndash;252).</p>
<p>In almost every age and country we find a myth of a great fish
swallowing a man, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb470" href="#pb470"
name="pb470">470</a>]</span>who afterward finds his way out alive. Near
to the Cherokee myth are the Bible story of Jonah, and the Greek story
of Hercules, swallowed by a fish and coming out afterward alive, but
bald. For parallels and theories of the origin and meaning of the myth
among the ancient nations, see chapter <span class="sc">IX</span> of
Bouton&rsquo;s Bible Myths.</p>
<p>In an Ojibwa story, the great Manabozho is swallowed, canoe and all,
by the king of the fishes. With his war club he strikes repeated blows
upon the heart of the fish, which attempts to spew him out. Fearing
that he might drown in deep water, Manabozho frustrates the endeavor by
placing his canoe crosswise in the throat of the fish, and continues
striking at the heart until the monster makes for the shore and there
dies, when the hero makes his escape through a hole which the gulls
have torn in the side of the carcass (Schoolcraft, Algic Researches,
<span class="sc">I</span>, pp. 145&ndash;146).</p>
<p><a href="#s69">69.</a> <span class="sc">Atag&acirc;&prime;hi, the
enchanted lake</span> (p. <a href="#pb321" class="pageref">321</a>):
This story was heard from Swimmer, Ta&prime;gwadih&#301;&prime;, and
others, and is a matter of familiar knowledge to every hunter among the
East Cherokee. If Indian testimony be believed there is actually a
large bare flat of this name in the difficult recesses of the Great
Smoky mountains on the northern boundary of Swain county, North
Carolina, somewhere between the heads of Bradleys fork and Eagle creek.
It appears to be a great resort for bears and ducks, and is perhaps
submerged at long intervals, which would account for the legend.</p>
<p><i>Prayer, fasting, and vigil</i>&mdash;In Indian ritual, as among
the Orientals and in all ancient religions, these are prime requisites
for obtaining clearness of spiritual vision. In almost every tribe the
young warrior just entering manhood voluntarily subjected himself to an
ordeal of this kind, of several days&rsquo; continuance, in order to
obtain a vision of the &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; which was to be his guide
and protector for the rest of his life.</p>
<p><a href="#s70">70.</a> <span class="sc">The bride from the
south</span> (p. <a href="#pb322" class="pageref">322</a>): This unique
allegory was heard from both Swimmer and
Ta&prime;gw&#259;dih&#301;&prime; in nearly the same form. Hagar also
(MS Stellar Legends of the Cherokee) heard something of it from
Ay&acirc;sta, who, however, confused it with the Hagar variant of
<a href="#s11">number 11</a>, &ldquo;The Milky Way&rdquo; (see notes to
<a href="#s11">number 11</a>).</p>
<p>In a myth from British Columbia, &ldquo;The Hot and the Cold
Winds,&rdquo; the cold-wind people of the north wage war with the
hot-wind people of the south, until the Indians, whose country lay
between, and who constantly suffer from both sides, bring about a
peace, to be ratified by a marriage between the two parties.
Accordingly, the people of the south send their daughter to marry the
son of the north. The two are married and have one child, whom the
mother after a time decides to take with her to visit her own people in
the north. Her visit ended, she starts on her return, accompanied by
her elder brother. &ldquo;They embarked in a bark canoe for the country
of the cold. Her brother paddled. After going a long distance, and
while crossing a great lake, the cold became so intense that her
brother could not endure it any longer. He took the child from his
sister and threw it into the water. Immediately the air turned warm and
the child floated on the water as a lump of ice.&rdquo;&mdash;Teit,
Traditions of the Thompson River Indians, pp. 55, 56.</p>
<p><a href="#s71">71.</a> <span class="sc">The Ice Man</span> (p.
<a href="#pb322" class="pageref">322</a>): This story, told by Swimmer,
may be a veiled tradition of a burning coal mine in the mountains,
accidentally ignited in firing the woods in the fall, according to the
regular Cherokee practice, and finally extinguished by a providential
rainstorm. One of Buttrick&rsquo;s Cherokee informants told him that
&ldquo;a great while ago a part of the world was burned, though it is
not known now how, or by whom, but it is said that other land was
formed by washing in from the mountains&rdquo; (Antiquities, p. 7).</p>
<p>When the French built Fort Caroline, near the present Charleston,
South Carolina, in 1562, an Indian village was in the vicinity, but
shortly afterward the chief, with all his people, removed to a
considerable distance in consequence of a strange <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb471" href="#pb471" name=
"pb471">471</a>]</span>accident&mdash;&ldquo;a large piece of peat bog
[was] kindled by lightning and consumed, which he supposed to be the
work of artillery.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14277src" href=
"#xd25e14277" name="xd25e14277src">42</a></p>
<p>Volcanic activities, some of very recent date, have left many traces
in the Carolina mountains. A mountain in Haywood county, near the head
of Fines creek, has been noted for its noises and quakings for nearly a
century, one particular explosion having split solid masses of granite
as though by a blast of gunpowder. These shocks and noises used to
recur at intervals of two or three years, but have not now been noticed
for some time. In 1829 a violent earthquake on Valley river split open
a mountain, leaving a chasm extending for several hundred yards, which
is still to be seen. Satoola mountain, near Highlands, in Macon county,
has crevices from which smoke is said to issue at intervals. In Madison
county there is a mountain which has been known to rumble and smoke, a
phenomenon with which the Warm springs in the same county may have some
connection. Another peak, known as Shaking or Rumbling bald, in
Rutherford county, attracted widespread attention in 1874 by a
succession of shocks extending over a period of six months (see Zeigler
and Grosscup, Heart of the Alleghanies, pp. 228&ndash;229).</p>
<p><a href="#s72">72.</a> <span class="sc">The Hunter and Selu</span>
(p. <a href="#pb323" class="pageref">323</a>): The explanation of this
story, told by Swimmer, lies in the myth which derives corn from the
blood of the old woman Selu (see <a href="#s3">number 3</a>,
&ldquo;Kana&prime;t&#301; and Selu&rdquo;).</p>
<p>In Iroquois myth the spirits of Corn, Beans, and Squash are three
sisters. Corn was originally much more fertile, but was blighted by the
jealousy of an evil spirit. &ldquo;To this day, when the rustling wind
waves the corn leaves with a moaning sound, the pious Indian fancies
that he hears the Spirit of Corn, in her compassion for the red man,
still bemoaning with unavailing regrets her blighted
fruitfulness&rdquo; (Morgan, League of the Iroquois, p. 162). See
<a href="#s126">number 126</a>, &ldquo;Plant Lore,&rdquo; and
accompanying notes.</p>
<p><a href="#s73">73.</a> <span class="sc">The Underground
Panthers</span> (p. <a href="#pb324" class="pageref">324</a>): This
story was told by John Ax. For an explanation of the Indian idea
concerning animals see <a href="#s15">number 15</a>, &ldquo;The
Four-footed Tribes,&rdquo; and <a href="#s76">number 76</a>, &ldquo;The
Bear Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Several days</i>&mdash;The strange lapse of time, by which a
period really extending over days or even years seems to the stranger
under the spell to be only a matter of a few hours, is one of the most
common incidents of European fairy recitals, and has been made equally
familiar to American readers through Irving&rsquo;s story of Rip Van
Winkle.</p>
<p><a href="#s74">74.</a> <span class="sc">The
Tsundige&prime;w&#301;</span> (p. <a href="#pb325" class=
"pageref">325</a>): This curious story was told by Swimmer and
Ta&prime;gw&#259;dih&#301;&prime; (east) and Wafford (west). Swimmer
says the dwarfs lived in the west, but
Ta&prime;gw&#259;dih&#301;&prime; and Wafford locate them south from
the Cherokee country.</p>
<p>A story which seems to be a variant of the same myth was told to the
Spanish adventurer Ayllon by the Indians on the South Carolina coast in
1520, and is thus given in translation from Peter Martyr&rsquo;s
Decades, in the Discovery and Conquest of Florida, ninth volume of the
Hakluyt Society&rsquo;s publications, pages XV-XVI, London, 1851.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another of Ayllon&rsquo;s strange stories refers to a country
called Inzignanin, &hellip; The inhabitauntes, by report of their
ancestors, say, that a people as tall as the length of a man&rsquo;s
arme, with tayles of a spanne long, sometime arrived there, brought
thither by sea, which tayle was not movable or wavering, as in
foure-footed beastes, but solide, broad above, and sharpe beneath, as
wee see in fishes and crocodiles, and extended into a bony hardness.
Wherefore, when they desired to sitt, they used seates with holes
through them, or wanting them, digged upp the earth a spanne deepe or
little more, they must convay their tayle into the hole when they rest
them.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb472" href="#pb472" name=
"pb472">472</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is given thus in Barcia, Ensayo, page 5: &ldquo;<span lang=
"es">Tambien llegaron a la Provincia de Yncignavin adonde les contaron
aquellos Indios, que en cierto tiempo, avian aportado &agrave; ella,
unas Gentes, que tenian Cola &hellip; de una quarta de largo, flexible,

que el Pellejo era mui aspero, y como escamoso, y que com&igrave;an
solo Peces crudos: y aviendo estos muerto, se acab&ograve; esta Nacion,
y la Verdad del Caso, con ella.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>A close parallel to the Cherokee story is found among the Nisqualli
of Washington, in a story of three [four?] brothers, who are captured
by a <span class="corr" id="xd25e14343" title=
"Source: mircaculously">miraculously</span> strong dwarf who ties them
and carries them off in his canoe. &ldquo;Having rounded the distant
point, where they had first descried him, they came to a village
inhabited by a race of people as small as their captor, their houses,
boats and utensils being all in proportion to themselves. The three
brothers were then taken out and thrown, bound as they were, into a
lodge, while a council was convened to decide upon their fate. During
the sitting of the council an immense flock of birds, resembling geese,
but much larger, pounced down upon the inhabitants and commenced a
violent attack. These birds had the power of throwing their sharp
quills like the porcupine, and although the little warriors fought with
great valour, they soon became covered with the piercing darts and all
sunk insensible on the ground. When all resistance has ceased, the
birds took to flight and disappeared. The brothers had witnessed the
conflict from their place of confinement, and with much labour had
succeeded in releasing themselves from their bonds, when they went to
the battle ground, and commenced pulling the quills from the apparently
lifeless bodies; but no sooner had they done this, than all instantly
returned to consciousness&rdquo; (Kane, Wanderings of an Artist, pp.
252&ndash;253).</p>
<p><a href="#s75">75.</a> <span class="sc">Origin of the Bear</span>
(p. <a href="#pb325" class="pageref">325</a>): This story was told by
Swimmer, from whom were also obtained the hunting songs, and was
frequently referred to by other informants. The
Ani&prime;-Ts&acirc;&prime;g&ucirc;h&#301; are said to have been an
actual clan in ancient times. For parallels, see <a href="#s76">number
76</a>, &ldquo;The Bear Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Had not taken human food</i>&mdash;The Indian is a thorough
believer in the doctrine that &ldquo;man is what he eats.&rdquo; Says
Adair (History of the American Indians, p. 133): &ldquo;They believe
that nature is possessed of such a property as to transfuse into men
and animals the qualities, either of the food they use or of those
objects that are presented to their senses. He who feeds on venison is,
according to their physical system, swifter and more sagacious than the
man who lives on the flesh of the clumsy bear or helpless dunghill
fowls, the slow-footed tame cattle, or the heavy wallowing swine. This
is the reason that several of their old men recommend and say that
formerly their greatest chieftains observed a constant rule in their
diet, and seldom ate of any animal of a gross quality or heavy motion
of body, fancying it conveyed a dullness through the whole system and
disabled them from exerting themselves with proper vigour in their
martial, civil, and religious duties.&rdquo; A continuous adherence to
the diet commonly used by a bear will finally give to the eater the
bear nature, if not also the bear form and appearance. A certain term
of &ldquo;white man&rsquo;s food&rdquo; will give the Indian the white
man&rsquo;s nature, so that neither the remedies nor the spells of the
Indian doctor will have any effect upon him (see the author&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees,&rdquo; in Seventh Annual
Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1891).</p>
<p><i>Shall live always</i>&mdash;For explanation of the doctrine of
animal reincarnation, see <a href="#s15">number 15</a>, &ldquo;The
Four-footed Tribes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The songs</i>&mdash;These are fair specimens of the hunting songs
found in every tribe, and intended to call up the animals or to win the
favor of the lords of the game (see also deer songs in notes to

G&acirc;te&prime;gw&acirc; (-h&#301;) are four mountains, under each of
which the bears have a townhouse in which they hold a dance before
retiring to their dens for their winter sleep. At Tsistu&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Rabbit place,&rdquo; known to us as Gregory bald, in the Great
Smoky range, dwells the Great Rabbit, the chief of the rabbit tribe. At
Kuw&acirc;&prime;h&#301;, &ldquo;Mulberry place,&rdquo; farther
northeast along the same range, resides the White Bear, the chief of
the bear tribe, and near by is the enchanted lake of
Atag&acirc;&prime;h&#301;, to which wounded bears go to bathe and be
cured (see <a href="#s15">number 15</a>, &ldquo;The Four-footed

identical with Fodderstack mountain (see also the <a href=

<p><a href="#s76">76.</a> <span class="sc">The Bear Man</span> (p.
<a href="#pb327" class="pageref">327</a>): This story was obtained
first from John Ax, and has numerous parallels in other tribes, as well
as in European and oriental folklore. The classic legend of Romulus and
Remus and the stories of &ldquo;wolf boys&rdquo; in India will at once
suggest themselves. Swimmer makes the trial of the hunter&rsquo;s
weapons by the bears a part of his story of the origin of disease and
medicine (<a href="#s4">number 4</a>), but says that it may have
happened on this occasion (see also <a href="#s15">number 15</a>,
&ldquo;The Four-footed Tribes,&rdquo; and notes to <a href=
"#s75">number 75</a>, &ldquo;Origin of the Bear&rdquo;).</p>
<p>In a strikingly similar Creek myth of the Tuggle collection,
&ldquo;Origin of the Bear Clan,&rdquo; a little girl lost in the woods
is adopted by a she-bear, with whom she lives for four years, when the
bear is killed by the hunter and the girl returns to her people to
become the mother of the Bear clan.</p>
<p>The Iroquois have several stories of children adopted by bears. In
one, &ldquo;The Man and His Stepson,&rdquo; a boy thus cared for is
afterward found by a hunter, who tames him and teaches him to speak,
until in time he almost forgets that he had lived like a bear. He
marries a daughter of the hunter and becomes a hunter himself, but
always refrains from molesting the bears, until at last, angered by the
taunts of his mother-in-law, he shoots one, but is himself killed by an
accident while on his return home (Smith, Myths of the Iroquois, in
Second Annual Report Bureau of Ethnology). In line with this is the
story of a hunter who had pursued a bear into its den. &ldquo;When some
distance in he could no longer see the bear, but he saw a fire and
around it sat several men. The oldest of the three men looked up and
asked, &lsquo;Why did you try to shoot one of my men. We sent him out
to entice you to us&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; (Curtin, Seneca MS in Bureau
of American Ethnology archives).</p>
<p>In a Pawnee myth, &ldquo;The Bear Man,&rdquo; a boy whose father had
put him under the protection of the bears grows up with certain bear
traits and frequently prays and sacrifices to these animals. On a war
party against the Sioux he is killed and cut to pieces, when two bears
find and recognize the body, gather up and arrange the pieces and
restore him to life, after which they take him to their den, where they
care for him and teach him their secret knowledge until he is strong
enough to go home (Grinnell, Pawnee Hero Stories, pp.
121&ndash;128).</p>
<p>In a Jicarilla myth, &ldquo;Origin and Destruction of the
Bear,&rdquo; a boy playing about in animal fashion runs into a cave in
the hillside. &ldquo;When he came out his feet and hands had been
transformed into bear&rsquo;s paws.&rdquo; Four times this is repeated,
the change each time mounting higher, until he finally emerges as a
terrible bear monster that devours human beings (Russell, Myths of the
Jicarilla, in Journal of American Folk-Lore, October, 1898).</p>
<p><i>Read the thoughts</i>&mdash;Thought reading is a very common
feature of Indian myths. Certain medicine ceremonies are believed to
confer the power upon those who fulfil the ordeal conditions.</p>
<p><i>Food was getting scarce</i>&mdash;Several references in the myths
indicate that, through failure of the accustomed wild crops, famine
seasons were as common among the animal tribes as among the Indians
(see <a href="#s33">number 33</a>, &ldquo;The Migration of the

crests of upright hair formerly worn by warriors of the Cherokee and
other eastern tribes. Timberlake thus describes the Cherokee
warrior&rsquo;s headdress in 1762: &ldquo;The hair of their head is
shaved, tho&rsquo; many of the old people have it plucked out by the
roots, except a patch on the hinder part of the head about twice the
bigness of a crown piece, which is ornamented with beads, feathers,
wampum, stained deer&rsquo;s hair, and such like baubles&rdquo;

<p><i>Cover the blood</i>&mdash;The reincarnation of the slain animal
from the drops of blood spilt upon the ground or from the bones is a
regular part of Cherokee hunting belief, and the same idea occurs in
the folklore of many tribes. In the Omaha myth, &ldquo;Ictinike and the
Four Creators,&rdquo; the hero visits the Beaver, who kills and cooks
one of his own children to furnish the dinner. When the meal was over
&ldquo;the Beaver gathered the bones and put them into a skin, which he
plunged beneath the water. In a moment the youngest beaver came up
alive out of the water&rdquo; (Dorsey, in Contributions to North
American Ethnology, <span class="sc">VI</span>, p. 557).</p>
<p><i>Like a man again</i>&mdash;It is a regular article of Indian
belief, which has its parallels in European fairy lore, that one who
has eaten the food of the spirit people or supernaturals can not
afterward return to his own people and live, unless at once, and
sometimes for a long time, put under a rigid course of treatment
intended to efface the longing for the spirit food and thus to restore
his complete human nature. See also <a href="#s73">number 73</a>,
&ldquo;The Underground Panthers.&rdquo; In &ldquo;A Yankton
Legend,&rdquo; recorded by Dorsey, a child falls into the water and is
taken by the water people. The father hears the child crying under the
water and employs two medicine men to bring it back. After preparing
themselves properly they go down into the deep water, where they find
the child sitting beside the water spirit, who, when they declare their
message, tells them that if they had come before the child had eaten
anything he might have lived, but now if taken away &ldquo;he will
desire the food which I eat; that being the cause of the trouble, he
shall die.&rdquo; They return and report: &ldquo;We have seen your
child, the wife of the water deity has him. Though we saw him alive, he
had eaten part of the food which the water deity eats, therefore the
water deity says that if we bring the child back with us out of the
water he shall die,&rdquo; and so it happened. Some time after the
parents lose another child in like manner, but this time &ldquo;she did
not eat any of the food of the water deity and therefore they took her
home alive.&rdquo; In each case a white dog is thrown in to satisfy the
water spirits for the loss of the child (Contributions to North
American Ethnology, <span class="sc">VI</span>, p. 357).</p>
<p><a href="#s77">77.</a> <span class="sc">The Great Leech of
Tlanusi&prime;y&#301;</span> (p. <a href="#pb329" class=
"pageref">329</a>): This legend was heard first from Swimmer and Chief
Smith, the latter of whom was born near Murphy; it was confirmed by
Wafford (west) and others, being one of the best known myths in the
tribe and embodied in the Cherokee name for Murphy. It is apparently
founded upon a peculiar appearance, as of something alive or moving, at
the bottom of a deep hole in Valley river, just below the old Unicoi
turnpike ford, at Murphy, in Cherokee county, North Carolina. It is
said that a tinsmith of the town once made a tin bomb which he filled
with powder and sank in the stream at this spot with the intention of
blowing up the strange object to see what it might be, but the
contrivance failed to explode. The hole is caused by a sudden drop or
split in the rock bed of the stream, extending across the river.
Wafford, who once lived on Nottely river, adds the incident of the two
women and says that the Leech had wings and could fly. He asserts also
that he found rich lead ore in the hole, but that the swift current
prevented working it. About two miles above the mouth of Nottely river
a bend of the stream brings it within about the same distance of the
Hiwassee at Murphy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb475" href="#pb475"
name="pb475">475</a>]</span>This nearest point of approach on Nottely
is also known to the Cherokee as Tlanusi&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;leech
place,&rdquo; and from certain phenomena common to both streams it is a
general belief among Indians and whites that they are connected here by
a subterranean water way. The legend and the popular belief are thus
noted in 1848 by Lanman, who incorrectly makes the leech a turtle:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little village of Murphy, whence I date this letter, lies
at the junction of the Owassa and Valley rivers, and in point of
location is one of the prettiest places in the world. Its Indian name
was Klausuna, or the Large Turtle. It was so called, says a Cherokee
legend, on account of its being the sunning place of an immense turtle
which lived in its vicinity in ancient times. The turtle was
particularly famous for its repelling power, having been known not to
be at all injured by a stroke of lightning. Nothing on earth had power
to annihilate the creature; but, on account of the many attempts made
to take its life, when it was known to be a harmless and inoffensive
creature, it became disgusted with this world, and burrowed its way
into the middle of the earth, where it now lives in peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In connection with this legend, I may here mention what must
be considered a remarkable fact in geology. Running directly across the
village of Murphy is a belt of marble, composed of the black, grey,
pure white and flesh-colored varieties, which belt also crosses the
Owassa river. Just above this marble causeway the Owassa, for a space
of perhaps two hundred feet, is said to be over one hundred feet deep,
and at one point, in fact, a bottom has never been found. All this is
simple truth, but I have heard the opinion expressed that there is a
subterranean communication between this immense hole in Owassa and the
river Notely, which is some two miles distant. The testimony adduced in
proof of this theory is, that a certain log was once marked on the
Notely, which log was subsequently found floating in the pool of the
Deep Hole in the Owassa&rdquo; (Letters, pp. 63&ndash;64).</p>
<p><a href="#s78">78.</a> <span class="sc">The
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; and other spirit folk</span> (p.
<a href="#pb330" class="pageref">330</a>): The belief in fairies and
kindred spirits, frequently appearing as diminutive beings in human
form, is so universal among all races as to render citation of
parallels unnecessary. Every Indian tribe has its own spirits of the
woods, the cliffs, and the waters, usually benevolent and kindly when
not disturbed, but often mischievous, and in rare cases malicious and
revengeful. These invisible spirit people are regarded as a sort of
supernatural human beings, entirely distinct from ghosts and from the
animal and plant spirits, as well as from the godlike beings who rule
the sun, the rain, and the thunder. Most of the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; stories here given were told by
Wafford, who believed them all firmly in spite of his white man&rsquo;s
blood and education. The others, excepting that of the offended spirits
(Wahnenauhi MS) and the Fire-carrier (Wafford), were heard from various
persons upon the reservation. For other
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; references see the stories of
Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301;, K&#259;na&prime;sta, Yahula, etc.</p>
<p><i>N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;</i>&mdash;This word
(<i>g&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301;</i> in a dialectic form and
<i>nay&#277;&prime;h&#301;</i> in the singular) may be rendered
&ldquo;dwellers anywhere&rdquo; or &ldquo;those who live
anywhere,&rdquo; but is understood to mean &ldquo;those who live
forever,&rdquo; i. e., Immortals. It is spelled <i>Nanehi</i> by
Buttrick and <i>Nuhnayie</i> in the Wahnenauhi manuscript. The singular
form, <i>Nay&#277;&prime;h&#301;</i>, occurs also as a personal name,
equivalent to <i>Ed&acirc;&prime;h&#301;</i>, &ldquo;One who goes
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Some invisible townhouse</i>&mdash;The ancient Creek town of
Okmulgee, where now is the city of Macon, in Georgia, was destroyed by
the Carolina people about the time of the Yamassee war. Sixty years
later Adair says of the Creeks: &ldquo;They strenuously aver that when
the necessity forces them to encamp there, they always hear at the dawn
of the morning the usual noise of Indians singing their joyful
religious notes and dancing, as if going down to the river to purify
themselves, and then returning to the old townhouse; with a great deal
more to the same effect. Whenever I have been there, however, all hath
been silent&#8202;&hellip;. But they say this was &lsquo;because I am
an obdurate infidel that way&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; (Hist. Am. Indians,
p. 36).</p>
<p><i>Nottely town</i>&mdash;Properly Na&prime;d&ucirc;&#699;l&#301;,
was on Nottely river, a short distance above <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href="#pb476" name=
"pb476">476</a>]</span>Raper creek in Cherokee county, North Carolina.
The old townhouse was upon a large mound on the west side of the river
and about five miles below the Georgia line. The town was practically
deserted before the removal in 1838 (see <a href=
"#gloss">glossary</a>).</p>
<p><i>Hemptown</i>&mdash;Properly Gat&ucirc;&ntilde;lti&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Hemp place,&rdquo; existed until the Removal, on Hemptown creek,
a branch of Toccoa river, a few miles north of the present Morganton,
in Fannin county, Georgia.</p>
<p><i>Noted circular depression</i>&mdash;This may have been a circular
earthwork of about thirty feet diameter, described as existing in 1890
a short distance east of Soquee post-office near the head of Soquee
creek, about ten miles northwest of Clarkesville, Habersham county,
Georgia. There are other circular structures of stone on elevated
positions within a few miles of Clarkesville (see author&rsquo;s
manuscript notes on Cherokee archeology, in Bureau of American
Ethnology archives). The same story about throwing logs and stones into
one of these sacred places, only to have them thrown out again by
invisible hands, is told by Zeigler and Grosscup, in connection with
the Jutaculla old fields (see note under <a href="#s81">number 81</a>,
&ldquo;Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;<span class="corr" id=
"xd25e14537" title="Source: .&rdquo;">&rdquo;).</span></p>
<p><i>Bewildered</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Crazy persons were supposed to be
possessed with the devil or afflicted with the Nanehi&rdquo; (Buttrick,
Antiquities, p. 14). According to Hagar&rsquo;s informant: &ldquo;The
little people cause men to lose their minds and run away and wander in
the forests. They wear very long hair, down to their heels&rdquo; (MS
Stellar Legends of the Cherokee). In Creek belief, according to the
Tuggle manuscript, &ldquo;Fairies or little people live in hollow trees
and on rocky cliffs. They often decoy people from their homes and lose
them in the woods. When a man&rsquo;s mind becomes bewildered&mdash;not
crazy&mdash;this is caused by the little people.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Loaves seemed to shrink</i>&mdash;The deceptive and
unsatisfactory character of all fairy belongings when the spell is
lifted is well known to the European peasantry.</p>
<p><i>Ts&#259;wa&prime;s&#301; and
Ts&#259;ga&prime;s&#301;</i>&mdash;These sprites are frequently named
in the hunting prayers and other sacred formulas.</p>
<p><i>Scratching</i>&mdash;This is a preliminary rite of the ballplay
and other ceremonies, as well as the doctor&rsquo;s method of
hypodermic injection. As performed in connection with the ballplay it
is a painful operation, being inflicted upon the naked skin with a
seven-toothed comb of turkey bone, the scratches being drawn in
parallel lines upon the breast, back, arms and legs, until the sufferer
is bleeding from head to foot. In medical practice, in order that the
external application may take hold more effectually, the scratching is
done with a rattlesnake&rsquo;s tooth, a brier, a flint, or a piece of
glass. See author&rsquo;s Cherokee Ball Play, in American
Anthropologist, April, 1890, and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees, in
Seventh Annual Report Bureau of Ethnology, 1891. The practice seems to
have been general among the southern tribes, and was sometimes used as
a punishment for certain delinquents. According to Adair the doctor
bled patients by scratching them with the teeth of garfish after the
skin had been first well softened by the application of warm water,
while any unauthorized person who dared to intrude upon the sacred
square during ceremonial performances &ldquo;would be dry-scratched
with snakes&rsquo; teeth, fixed in the middle of a split reed or piece
of wood, without the privilege of warm water to supple the stiffened
skin&rdquo; (Hist. Am. Indians, pp. 46, 120).</p>
<p><i>The Fire-carrier</i>&mdash;This is probably the gaseous
phenomenon known as the will-of-the-wisp, which has been a thing of
mystery and fear to others beside Indians.</p>
<p><a href="#s79">79.</a> <span class="sc">The removed

elsewhere as a self-taught mechanic of the East Cherokee. Wafford
(west) had also heard it, but confused it with that of
Tsal&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime; (<a href="#s81">number 81</a>).</p>
<p>Excepting Gust&#301;&prime;, the localities are all in western North
Carolina. The large mound of S&#277;&#699;ts&#301; is on the south side
of Valley river, about three miles below Valleytown, in Cherokee
county. Anisgaya&prime;y&#301; town is not definitely located by the
story teller, but was probably in the same neighborhood.
Tsudaye&#699;l&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, literally &ldquo;where it

peak near Cheowa Maximum, a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb477" href=

Robbinsville, in Graham county, on the summit of which there is said to
be a large rock somewhat resembling in appearance a circular townhouse
with a part wanting from one side.
Du&prime;stiya&#699;l&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Where it was

the territory on Hiwassee river, about the mouth of Shooting creek,
above Hayesville, in Clay county (see also <a href=

<p><i>No one must shout</i>&mdash;The same injunction occurs in the

fairy guides is constantly emphasized in European folklore.</p>

N&#301;kw&#259;s&#301;&prime; or N&#301;kw&#700;s&#301;&prime;, one of
the most ancient settlements of the Cherokee, was on the west bank of
Little Tennessee river, where is now the town of Franklin, in Macon
county, North Carolina. The mound upon which the townhouse stood, in a
field adjoining the river, is probably the largest in western Carolina
and has never been explored. The Cherokee believe that it is the abode
of the N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; or Immortals (see <a href=
"#s78">number 78</a>) and that a perpetual fire burns within it. The
name, which can not be translated, appears as Nucassee in old
documents. The British agent held a council here with the Cherokee as
early as 1730. Although twice destroyed, the town was rebuilt and
continued to be occupied probably until the land was sold in 1819.</p>
<p><i>Bring the news home</i>&mdash;It was a frequent custom in Indian
warfare to spare a captive taken in battle in order that he might carry
back to his people the news of the defeat. After the disastrous defeat
of the French under D&rsquo;Artaguette by the Chickasaw in upper
Mississippi in 1736, D&rsquo;Artaguette, Lieutenant Vincennes, Father
Senac, and fifteen others were burned at the stake by the victors, but
&ldquo;one of the soldiers was spared to carry the news of the triumph
of the Chickasaws and the death of these unhappy men to the mortified
Bienville&rdquo; (Pickett, History of Alabama, p. 298, ed. 1896).</p>
<p><a href="#s81">81.</a> <span class=
"sc">Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;, the slant-eyed giant</span> (p.
<a href="#pb337" class="pageref">337</a>): The story of
Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime; is one of the finest and best known of
the Cherokee legends. It is mentioned as early as 1823 by Haywood, who
spells the name Tuli-cula, and the memory is preserved in the local
nomenclature of western Carolina. Hagar also alludes briefly to it in
his manuscript Stellar Legends of the Cherokee. The name signifies
literally &ldquo;he has them slanting,&rdquo; being understood to refer
to his eyes, although the word eye (<i>akt&#259;&prime;</i>, plural
<i>dikt&#259;&prime;</i>) is not a part of it. In the plural form it is
also the name of a traditional race of giants in the far west (see
<a href="#s106">number 106</a>, &ldquo;The Giants from the
West&rdquo;). Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime; lives in
Tsuneg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301; and is the great lord of the game,
and as such is frequently invoked in the hunting formulas. The story
was obtained from Swimmer and John Ax, the Swimmer version being the
one here followed. For parallels to the incident of the child born from
blood see notes to <a href="#s3">number 3</a>,
&ldquo;Kana&prime;t&#301; and Selu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the John Ax version it is the girl&rsquo;s father and mother,
instead of her mother and brother, who try to bring her back. They are
told they must fast seven days to succeed. They fast four days before
starting, and then set out and travel two days, when they come to the
mouth of the cave and hear the sound of the drum and the dance within.
They are able to look over the edge of the rock and see their daughter
among the dancers, but can not enter until the seventh day is arrived.
Unluckily the man is very hungry by this time, and after watching
nearly all night he insists that it is so near daylight of the seventh
morning that he may safely take a small <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb478" href="#pb478" name="pb478">478</a>]</span>bite. His wife begs
him to wait until the sun appears, but hunger overcomes him and he
takes a bite of food from his pouch. Instantly the cave and the dancers
disappear, and the man and his wife find themselves alone on the
mountain. John Ax was a very old man at the time of the recital, with
memory rapidly failing, and it is evident that his version is only
fragmentary.</p>
<p>Haywood notes the story on the authority of Charles Hicks, an
educated halfbreed (Nat. and Aborig. Hist. Tenn., p. 280): &ldquo;They
have a fabulous tradition respecting the mounds, which proves that they
are beyond the events of their history. The mounds, they say, were
caused by the quaking of the earth and great noise with it, a ceremony
used for the adoption of their people into the family of Tuli-cula, who
was an invisible person and had taken a wife of one of their
town&rsquo;s people. And at the time when his first son was born the
quaking of the earth and noise had commenced, but had ceased at the
alarm whoop, which had been raised by two imprudent young men of the
town, in consequence of which the mounds had been raised by the quaking
noise. Whereupon the father took the child and mother and removed to
near Brasstown, and had made the tracks in the rocks which are to be
seen there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Buttrick we get the following version of the tradition,
evidently told for the missionary&rsquo;s special benefit: &ldquo;God
directed the Indians to ascend a certain mountain&mdash;that is, the
warriors&mdash;and he would there send them assistance. They started
and had ascended far up the mountain, when one of the warriors began to
talk about women. His companion immediately reproved him, but instantly
a voice like thunder issued from the side of the mountain and God spoke
and told them to return, as he could not assist them on account of that
sin. They put the man to death, yet the Lord never returned to them
afterwards&rdquo; (Antiquities, p. 14). On the next page he tells it in
a somewhat different form: &ldquo;It is said that before coming to this
continent, while in their own country, they were in great distress from
their enemies, and God told them to march to the top of a certain
mountain and He would come down and afford them relief. They ascended
far up the mountain and thought they saw something coming down from
above, which they supposed was for their aid. But just then one of the
warriors,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>Zeigler and Grosscup give another version, which, although dressed
up for advertising purposes, makes a fairly good story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is another legend of the Balsams more significant
than any of these. It is the Paradise Gained of Cherokee mythology, and
bears some distant resemblance to the Christian doctrine of mediation.
The Indians believed that they were originally mortal in spirit as well
as body, but above the blue vault of heaven there was, inhabited by a
celestial race, a forest into which the highest mountains lifted their
dark summits. * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mediator, by whom eternal life was secured for the Indian
mountaineers, was a maiden of their own tribe. Allured by the haunting
sound and diamond sparkle of a mountain stream, she wandered far up
into a solitary glen, where the azalea, the kalmia, and the
rhododendron brilliantly embellished the deep, shaded slopes, and
filled the air with their delicate perfume. The crystal stream wound
its crooked way between moss-covered rocks over which tall ferns bowed
their graceful stems. Enchanted by the scene, she seated herself upon
the soft moss, and, overcome by fatigue, was soon asleep. The dream
picture of a fairyland was presently broken by the soft touch of a
strange hand. The spirit of her dream occupied a place at her side,
and, wooing, won her for his bride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her supposed abduction caused great excitement among her
people, who made diligent search for her recovery in their own
villages. Being unsuccessful, they made war upon the neighboring tribes
in the hope of finding the place of her concealment. Grieved because of
so much bloodshed and sorrow, she besought the great chief of the
eternal hunting grounds to make retribution. She was accordingly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb479" href="#pb479" name=
"pb479">479</a>]</span>appointed to call a council of her people at the
forks of the Wayeh (Pigeon) river. She appeared unto the chiefs in a
dream, and charged them to meet the spirits of the hunting ground with
fear and reverence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the hour appointed the head men of the Cherokees
assembled. The high Balsam peaks were shaken by thunder and aglare with
lightning. The cloud, as black as midnight, settled over the valley,
then lifted, leaving upon a large rock a cluster of strange men, armed
and painted as for war. An enraged brother of the abducted maiden swung
his tomahawk and raised the war whoop, but a swift thunderbolt
dispatched him before the echo had died in the hills. The chiefs,
terror-stricken, fled to their towns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bride, grieved by the death of her brother and the
failure of the council, prepared to abandon her new home and return to
her kindred in the valleys. To reconcile her the promise was granted
that all brave warriors and their faithful women should have an eternal
home in the happy hunting ground above, after death. The great chief of
the forest beyond the clouds became the guardian spirit of the
Cherokees. All deaths, either from wounds in battle or disease, were
attributed to his desire to make additions to the celestial hunting
ground, or, on the other hand, to his wrath, which might cause their
unfortunate spirits to be turned over to the disposition of the evil
genius of the mountain tops.&rdquo;&mdash;Heart of the Alleghanies, pp.
22&ndash;24.</p>
<p><i>K&#259;nu&prime;ga</i>&mdash;An ancient Cherokee town on Pigeon
river, in the present Haywood county, North Carolina. It was deserted
before the beginning of the historic period, but may have been located
about the junction of the two forks of Pigeon river, a few miles east
of Waynesville, where there are still a number of mounds and ancient
cemeteries extending for some miles down the stream. Being a frontier
town, it was probably abandoned early on account of its exposed
position. The name, signifying &ldquo;scratcher,&rdquo; is applied to a
comb, used for scratching the ballplayers, and is connected with
<i>k&#259;nug&ucirc;&prime;&#699;l&#259;</i>, or
<i>nug&ucirc;&prime;&#699;l&#259;</i>, a blackberry bush or brier.
There are other mounds on Richland creek, in the neighborhood of
Waynesville.</p>
<p><i>Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;
Tsuneg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;</i>&mdash;Abbreviated
Tsuneg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;; the mountain in which the giant is
supposed to have his residence, is Tennessee bald, in North Carolina,
where the Haywood, Jackson, and Transylvania county lines come
together, on the ridge separating the waters of Pigeon river from those
flowing into Tennessee creek and Cany fork of the Tuckasegee,
southeastward from Waynesville and Webster. The name seems to mean,
&ldquo;at the white place,&rdquo; from <i>une&prime;ga</i>,
&ldquo;white,&rdquo; and may refer to a bald spot of perhaps a hundred
acres on the top, locally known among the whites as Jutaculla old
fields, from a tradition, said to be derived from the Indians, that it
was a clearing made by &ldquo;Jutaculla&rdquo; (i. e.,
Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;) for a farm. Some distance farther
west, on the north side of Cany fork and about ten miles above Webster,
in Jackson county, is a rock known as Jutaculla rock, covered with
various rude carvings, which, according to the same tradition, are
scratches made by the giant in jumping from his farm on the mountain to
the creek below. Zeigler and Grosscup refer to the mountain under the
name of &ldquo;Old Field mountain&rdquo; and mention a tradition among
the pioneers that it was regarded by the Indians as the special abode
of the Indian Satan!</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the top of the mountain there is a prairie-like tract,
almost level, reached by steep slopes covered with thickets of balsam
and rhododendron, which seem to garrison the reputed sacred domain. It
was understood among the Indians to be forbidden territory, but a party
one day permitted their curiosity to tempt them. They forced a way
through the entangled thickets, and with merriment entered the open
ground. Aroused from sleep and enraged by their audacious intrusion,
the devil, taking the form of an immense snake, assaulted the party and
swallowed fifty of them before the thicket could be gained. Among the
first whites who settled among the Indians, and traded with them, was a
party of hunters who used this superstition <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb480" href="#pb480" name="pb480">480</a>]</span>to
escape punishment for their reprehensible conduct. They reported that
they were in league with the great spirit of evil, and to prove that
they were, frequented this &lsquo;old field.&rsquo; They described his
bed, under a large overhanging rock, as a model of neatness. They had
frequently thrown into it stones and brushwood during the day, while
the master was out, but the place was invariably as clean the next
morning &lsquo;as if it had been brushed with a bunch of
feathers&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; (Heart of the Alleghanies, p. 22).</p>
<p><i>The footprints can still be seen</i>&mdash;Shining rock or Cold
mountain, between the Forks of Pigeon river, in Haywood county, North
Carolina, is known to the Cherokee as
Datsu&prime;n&#259;l&acirc;sg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;where their tracks are this way,&rdquo; on account of a rock at
its base, toward Sonoma and three miles south of the trail, upon which
are impressions said to be the footprints made by the giant and his
children on their way to Tsuneg&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;. Within
the mountain is also the legendary abode of invisible spirits. Haywood
confounds this with Track Rock gap, near Blairsville, Georgia, where
are other noted petroglyphs (see <a href="#s125">number 125</a>, Minor
Legends of Georgia).</p>
<p>The rapid growth of the two children is paralleled in many other
tribal mythologies. The sequence of growth as indicated by the
footprints reminds us of the concluding incident of the Arabian Nights,
when Queen Scheherazade stands before the king to make a last request:
&ldquo;And the king answered her, &lsquo;Request, thou shalt receive, O
Scheherazade.&rsquo; So thereupon she called out to the nurses and the
eunuchs and said to them, &lsquo;Bring ye my children.&rsquo;
Accordingly they brought them to her quickly, and they were three male
children; one of them walked, and one crawled, and one was at the
breast.&rdquo;</p>

This story, obtained from Swimmer, bears resemblance to those of
Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;, Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301;, The
Removed Townhouses, and others, in which individuals, or even whole
settlements, elect to go with the invisible spirit people in order to
escape hardships or coming disaster.</p>
<p><i>K&#259;na&prime;sta</i>&mdash;Abbreviated from
K&#259;nast&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, a name which can not be
translated, is described as an ancient Cherokee town on the French
Broad where the trail from Tennessee creek of the Tuckasegee comes in,
near the present Brevard, in Transylvania county, North Carolina. No
mounds are known there, and we find no notice of the town in history,
but another of the same name existed on Hiwassee and was destroyed in
1776.</p>
<p><i>Tsuwa&#699;tel&prime;da</i>&mdash;Abbreviated from
Tsuwa&#699;teld&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;, and known to the whites
as Pilot knob, is a high mountain in Transylvania county, about eight
miles north of Brevard. On account of the peculiar stratified
appearance of the rocks, the faces of the cliffs are said frequently to
present a peculiar appearance under the sun&rsquo;s rays, as of shining
walls with doors, windows, and shingled roofs.</p>

<p><i>Fast seven days</i>&mdash;This injunction of a seven days&rsquo;
fast upon those who would join the spirit people appears in several
Cherokee myths, the idea being, as we learn from the priests, to
spiritualize the human nature and quicken the spiritual vision by
abstinence from earthly food. The doctrine is exemplified in an
incident of the legend of Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301;, q. v. In a
broader application, the same idea is a foundation principle of every
ancient religion. In ordinary Cherokee ceremonial the fast is kept for
one day&mdash;i. e., from midnight to sunset. On occasions of supreme
importance it continues four or even seven days. Among the plains
tribes those who voluntarily enter the Sun dance to make supplication
and sacrifice for their people abstain entirely from food and drink
during the four days and nights of the ceremony.</p>

"pagenum">[<a id="pb481" href="#pb481" name="pb481">481</a>]</span>is
of the same order as the legends of Tsul&#699;k&#259;l&ucirc;&prime;,
K&#259;na&prime;sta, etc. The people whom the hunter met inside the
enchanted mountain are evidently the same described in the last-named
story (<a href="#s82">number 82</a>), with the guests from the lost

<p>The name Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301; can not be translated, but may

<p><i>Parched corn</i>&mdash;This was the standard provision of the
warrior when on the march among all the tribes east of the Mississippi
and probably among all the corn-growing tribes of America. It is the
pinole of the Tarumari and other Mexican tribes. The Cherokee call it
<i>g&#259;h&#259;w&#301;&prime;sita</i>. Hawkins thus describes it as
seen with his Cherokee guides in 1796: &ldquo;They are small eaters,
use no salt and but little bread. They carry their parched corn meal,
<i>wissactaw</i>, and mix a handful in a pint of water, which they
drink. Although they had plenty of corn and fowls, they made no other
provision than a small bag of this for the path. I have plenty of
provisions and give them some at every meal. I have several times drank
of the wissactaw, and am fond of it with the addition of some sugar. To
make of the best quality, I am told the corn should first be boiled,
then parched in hot ashes, sifted, powdered, and made into
flour.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14781src" href="#xd25e14781"

Thunder&rsquo;s sister</span> (p. <a href="#pb345" class=
"pageref">345</a>): This story was heard first from John Ax, and
afterward with additions and variants from Swimmer and others. It is
also briefly noted in Hagar&rsquo;s manuscript &ldquo;Stellar Legends
of the Cherokee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As explained elsewhere, the Thunder spirits are supposed to have
their favorite residence under cataracts, of which Tallulah falls is
probably the greatest in the Cherokee country. The connection of
Thunder and Rain spirits with snakes and water animals is a matter of
universal primitive belief and has already been noted. One Cherokee
informant told Hagar (see above) that &ldquo;Thunder is a horned snake
(?), and lightning its tongue, and it lives with water and
rains.&rdquo; It is hardly necessary to state that the dance was, and
is, among all the tribes, not only the most frequent form of social
amusement, but also an important part of every great religious or other
ceremonial function.</p>
<p><i>S&acirc;kwi&prime;y&#301;</i>&mdash;Abbreviated
S&acirc;kwi&prime;, an ancient town about on the site of the present
village of Soquee on the creek of the same name near Clarkesville, in
Habersham county, Georgia.</p>
<p><i>Marry him</i>&mdash;Among nearly all the tribes, with the
exception of the Pueblo, the marriage ceremony was simple, consisting
chiefly of the giving, by the lover, of certain presents to the parents
of the intended bride, by way of compensating them for the loss of
their daughter, after she herself had first signified her consent to
the union. Although this has been represented as a purchase, it was
really only a formal ratification of the contract, which the girl was
free to accept or reject as she chose. On the other hand, should the
presents be insufficient to satisfy the parents, they were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb482" href="#pb482" name=
"pb482">482</a>]</span>refused or returned and the marriage could not
take place, however willing the girl might be. The young man usually
selected a friend to act as go-between with the girl&rsquo;s family,
and in all tribes&mdash;as now in the West&mdash;the result seems to
have been largely at the disposal of her brother, who continued to
exercise some supervision and claim over her even after her
marriage.</p>
<p>Lawson&rsquo;s statement concerning the eastern Carolina tribes in
1700 will hold almost equally good to-day in any part of the West:
&ldquo;As for the Indian marriages, I have read and heard of a great
deal of form and ceremony used, which I never saw; nor yet could learn
in the time I have been amongst them any otherwise than I shall here
give you an account of, which is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When any young Indian has a mind for such a girl to his wife,
he, or some one for him, goes to the young woman&rsquo;s parents, if
living; if not, to her nearest relations, where they make offers of the
match betwixt the couple. The relations reply, they will consider of
it; which serves for a sufficient answer, till there be a second
meeting about the marriage, which is generally brought into debate
before all the relations that are old people, on both sides, and
sometimes the king with all his great men give their opinions therein.
If it be agreed on and the young woman approve thereof&mdash;for these
savages never give their children in marriage without their own
consent&mdash;the man pays so much for his wife, and the handsomer she
is the greater price she bears&rdquo; (History of Carolina, pp.
302&ndash;303).</p>
<p>According to Adair, who makes it a little more formal among the Gulf
tribes, &ldquo;When an Indian makes his first address to the young
woman he intends to marry, she is obliged by ancient custom to sit by
him till he hath done eating and drinking, whether she likes or
dislikes him; but afterward she is at her own choice whether to stay or
retire&rdquo; (Hist. Am. Indians, p. 139).</p>
<p><i>Would surely die</i>&mdash;In Cherokee myth and ritual we
frequently meet the idea that one who reveals supernatural secrets will
die. Sometimes the idea is reversed, as when the discovery of the
nefarious doings of a wizard or conjurer causes his death. The latter
belief has its parallel in Europe.</p>
<p><i>Smooth as a pumpkin</i>&mdash;This is the rendering of the
peculiar tautologic Cherokee expression, <i>i&prime;ya
iya&prime;-t&#259;wi&prime;skage&mdash;t&#259;wi&prime;skage
i&prime;ya-iyu&prime;st&#301;</i>, literally, &ldquo;pumpkin, of
pumpkin smoothness&mdash;smooth like a pumpkin.&rdquo; The rendering is
in line with the repetition in such children&rsquo;s stories as that of
&ldquo;The House that Jack Built,&rdquo; but the translation fails to
convey the amusing sound effect of the original.</p>
<p><i>A large turtle</i>&mdash;This incident occurs also in <a href=
"#s83">number 83</a>, &ldquo;Tsuwe&prime;n&#259;h&#301;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>A horse</i>&mdash;Although the reference to the horse must be
considered a more modern interpolation it may easily date back two
centuries, or possibly even to De Soto&rsquo;s expedition in 1540.
Among the plains tribes the horse quickly became so essential a part of
Indian life that it now enters into their whole social and mythic
system.</p>
<p><i>The bracelets were snakes</i>&mdash;The same concept appears also
in <a href="#s63">number 63</a>,
&ldquo;&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime;,&rdquo; when the hero visits
his father, the Thunder god.</p>
<p><a href="#s85">85.</a> <span class="sc">The haunted whirlpool</span>
(p. <a href="#pb347" class="pageref">347</a>): This legend was related
by an East Cherokee known to the whites as Knotty Tom. For a
description of the whirlpool rapids known as The Suck, see notes under
<a href="#s63">number 63</a>, &ldquo;&Ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime;,
the Gambler.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#s86">86.</a> <span class="sc">Yahula</span> (p. <a href=
"#pb347" class="pageref">347</a>): This fine myth was obtained in the
Territory from Wafford, who had it from his uncle, William Scott, a
halfbreed who settled upon Yahoola creek shortly after the close of the
Revolution. Scott claimed to have heard the bells and the songs, and of
the story itself Wafford said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it so often and
so much that I&rsquo;m inclined to believe it.&rdquo; It has its
explanation in the beliefs connected with the
N&ucirc;&ntilde;n&#277;&prime;h&#301; (see <a href="#s78">number 78</a>
and notes), in whom Wafford had firm faith.</p>
<p><i>Yahula</i>&mdash;This is a rather frequent Cherokee personal
name, but seems to be of Creek origin, having reference to the song
used in the &ldquo;black drink&rdquo; or &ldquo;busk&rdquo; ceremony of
that tribe, and the songs which the lost trader used to sing may have
been those of that ceremony. See the <a href="#gloss">glossary</a>.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb483" href="#pb483" name=
"pb483">483</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Tinkling of the bells</i>&mdash;Among the southern tribes in the
old days the approach of a trader&rsquo;s cavalcade along the trail was
always heralded by the jingling of bells hung about the necks of the
horses, somewhat in the manner of our own winter sleighing parties.
Among the plains tribes the children&rsquo;s ponies are always equipped
with collars of sleigh bells.</p>
<p>In his description of a trader&rsquo;s pack-train before the
Revolution, Bartram says (Travels, p. 439): &ldquo;Every horse has a
bell on, which being stopped, when we start in the morning, with a
twist of grass or leaves, soon shakes out, and they are never stopped
again during the day. The constant ringing and clattering of the bells,
smacking of the whips, whooping and too frequent cursing these
miserable quadrupeds, cause an incessant uproar and confusion
inexpressibly disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#s87">87.</a> <span class="sc">The water cannibals</span>
(p. <a href="#pb349" class="pageref">349</a>): This story was obtained
from Swimmer and contains several points of resemblance to other
Cherokee myths. The idea of the spirit changeling is common to European
fairy lore.</p>
<p><i>T&#301;kw&#259;li&prime;ts&#301;</i>&mdash;This town, called by
the whites Tuckalechee, was on Tuckasegee river, at the present Bryson
City, in Swain county, North Carolina, where traces of the mound can
still be seen on the south side of the river.</p>
<p><i>Afraid of the witches</i>&mdash;See <a href="#s120">number
120</a>, &ldquo;The Raven Mocker,&rdquo; and notes.</p>
<p><a href="#s88">88.</a> <span class="sc">First contact with
whites</span> (p. <a href="#pb350" class="pageref">350</a>): The story
of the jug of whisky left near a spring was heard first from Swimmer;
the ul&ucirc;&ntilde;s&ucirc;&prime;t&#301; story from Wafford; the
locomotive story from David Blythe. Each was afterward confirmed from
other sources.</p>
<p>The story of the book and the bow, quoted from the Cherokee Advocate
of October 26, 1844, was not heard on the reservation, but is mentioned
by other authorities. According to an old Cherokee quoted by Buttrick,
&ldquo;God gave the red man a book and a paper and told him to write,
but he merely made marks on the paper, and as he could not read or
write, the Lord gave him a bow and arrows, and gave the book to the
white man.&rdquo; Boudinot, in &ldquo;A Star in the
West,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14951src" href="#xd25e14951"
name="xd25e14951src">44</a> quoted by the same author, says:
&ldquo;They have it handed down from their ancestors, that the book
which the white people have was once theirs; that while they had it
they prospered exceedingly; but that the white people bought it of them
and learned many things from it, while the Indians lost credit,
offended the Great Spirit, and suffered exceedingly from the
neighboring nations; that the Great Spirit took pity on them and
directed them to this country,&rdquo; etc. It is simply another version
of the common tale of decadent nations, &ldquo;We were once as great as
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#s89">89.</a> <span class="sc">The Iroquois wars</span> (p.
<a href="#pb351" class="pageref">351</a>): <i>The Iroquois
league</i>&mdash;The Iroquois league consisted originally of a
confederacy of five kindred tribes, the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga,
Cayuga, and Seneca, in what is now the state of New York; to these were
added the cognate Tuscarora after their expulsion from Carolina about
1715. The name Iroquois, by which they were known to the French, is
supposed to be a derivative from some Indian term. To the English they
were known as the Five, afterward the Six Nations. They called
themselves by a name commonly spelt Hodenosaunee, and interpreted
&ldquo;People of the Long House.&rdquo; Of this symbolic long house the
Mohawk guarded the eastern door, while the Seneca protected the
western. Their remarkable governmental and clan system is still well
preserved, each tribe, except the Mohawk and Oneida, having eight
clans, arranged in two groups or phratries. The Mohawk and Oneida are
said to have now but three clans apiece, probably because of their
losses by withdrawals to the French missions. The Seneca clans, which
are nearly the same for the other tribes, are the Wolf, Bear, Turtle,
Beaver, Deer, Snipe, Heron, and Hawk. The confederacy is supposed to
have been formed about the middle of the sixteenth century, and by 1680
the Iroquois had conquered and destroyed or incorporated all the
surrounding tribes, and had asserted a paramount <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb484" href="#pb484" name=
"pb484">484</a>]</span>claim over the whole territory from the Cherokee
border to Hudson bay and from southern New England to the Mississippi.
According to a careful estimate in 1677 the Five Nations then numbered
2,150 warriors, or about 10,750 persons. The Tuscarora in Carolina were
estimated a few years later at 1,200 warriors, or 5,000 persons, but
this is probably an exaggeration. The league afterward lost heavily by
wars with the French, and still more by withdrawals of Christianized
Indians to the French Catholic mission colonies at Caughnawaga, Saint
Regis, and elsewhere, the Mohawk being the chief sufferers. The
Revolution brought about another separation, when about two-fifths of
those remaining, including nearly all of the Mohawk and Cayuga, removed
in a body to Canada. A mixed band of Seneca and Cayuga, known as the
&ldquo;Seneca of Sandusky,&rdquo; had previously settled in Ohio,
whence they removed in 1831 to Indian Territory. Between 1820 and 1826
the greater portion of the Oneida removed from New York to lands in
Wisconsin purchased from the Menomini. In spite, however, of wars and
removals the Iroquois have held their own with a tenacity and a
virility which mark their whole history, and both in this country and
in Canada they are fairly prosperous and are increasing in population,
being apparently more numerous to-day than at any former period. Those
in New York and Pennsylvania, except the Saint Regis, and on the Grand
River reservation in Canada, constituting together about one-half of
the whole number, still keep up the forms and ceremonies of the ancient
league.</p>
<p>According to a special bulletin of the census of 1890 the total
number of Indians then belonging to the tribes originally constituting
the Six Nations was 15,833, of whom 8,483 were living in Canada and
7,350 in the United States, excluding from the latter count 37 resident
members of other tribes. Those in the United States were on six
reservations in the State of New York, one in Pennsylvania, one in
Wisconsin, and one in the Indian Territory, and were classed as
follows:</p>

<p>A few Algonkin are included among the Iroquois of Caughnawaga and
Saint Regis, the Iroquois of these two settlements having been
originally Catholic emigrants from the Mohawk villages in New York,
with a few Oneida and Onondaga. When the boundary line between New York
and Canada was run it cut the Saint Regis reservation in two. The
report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for 1900 shows
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb485" href="#pb485" name=
"pb485">485</a>]</span>7,700 Iroquois living on the reservations in New
York, Wisconsin, and Indian Territory, an increase within these limits
of 527 in nine years. Assuming the same rate of increase in
Pennsylvania and on the Canada side, the whole number of Iroquois
to-day would be approximately 17,000. For detailed information see
Colden, History of the Five Nations; Schoolcraft, Notes on the
Iroquois; Morgan, League of the Hodenosaunee or Iroquois;
Parkman&rsquo;s works; reports of the commissioners of Indian affairs
for both the United States and Canada, and the excellent report on
&ldquo;The Six Nations of New York,&rdquo; by Donaldson and Carrington,
contained in an extra bulletin of the Eleventh Census of the United
States.</p>
<p><i>Seneca town, South Carolina</i>&mdash;The statement given by
Schoolcraft (Notes on Iroquois, 161), on the authority of Calhoun, that
the Seneca once lived at Seneca town, in South Carolina, has probably
no foundation in fact, the story having evidently arisen from a
supposed similarity of name. The Cherokee call it
<i>I&#699;s&ucirc;&prime;nig&ucirc;&prime;</i>, and do not connect it
in any way with <i>A-S&#277;&prime;nik&#259;</i> or
<i>Ani&prime;-S&#277;&prime;nik&#259;</i>, their name for the northern
tribe.</p>
<p><i>The Cherokee war</i>&mdash;The Iroquois story of the war between
themselves and the Cherokee is from Schoolcraft, Notes on Iroquois,
pages 252 and 256.</p>
<p><i>Five days&rsquo; journey</i>&mdash;This statement is on
Morgan&rsquo;s authority, but the distance was certainly greater,
unless we are to understand only the distance that separated their
extreme accustomed hunting ranges, not that between the permanent
settlements of the two peoples.</p>
<p><i>The Tennessee river boundary</i>&mdash;The statement from Morgan
(League of the Iroquois, p. 337) in regard to the truce line
established at Tennessee river seems to find confirmation in incidental
references in early documents. Boundaries beyond which war parties
might not go, or neutral grounds where hereditary enemies met in peace,
were a regular institution in ancient Indian society, the most notable
instance being perhaps the famous pipestone quarry in Minnesota.
Notwithstanding the claim of the Iroquois, backed by Sir William
Johnson, to all the country north of the Tennessee river, it is very
plain from history and the treaties that the Cherokee asserted a more
or less valid claim as far north as the Ohio. Their actual settlements,
however, were all south of the main Tennessee.</p>
<p><i>The Buffalo dance</i>&mdash;The origin ascribed to the Buffalo
dance of the Iroquois (Morgan, League of the Iroquois, p. 287) is in
agreement with the common Indian idea, according to which dances named
from animals are performed in imitation of the peculiar actions and
cries of these animals, or in obedience to supposed commands from the
ruling spirit animals.</p>
<p><i>The peace embassy</i>&mdash;The story of the proposed intertribal
alliance, with the statements as to Cherokee captives among the Seneca,
are from Schoolcraft (Notes on Iroquois, pp. 158, 252, 257). The
records of the conference at Johnson Hall in 1768 are published in the
New York Colonial Documents. The account of the Iroquois peace embassy
to Echota was given to Wafford by two eyewitnesses, one of whom was his
mother&rsquo;s cousin, Sequoya. As the old man said, &ldquo;Sequoya
told me all about it.&rdquo; As stated in the narrative, Wafford
himself had also seen the belts brought out and explained in a great
intertribal council at Tahlequah. By common tribal custom ambassadors
of peace were secure from molestation, whatever might be the result of
the negotiations, although, as among more civilized nations, this rule
was sometimes violated. According to tradition, the ancient peace pipe
of the Cherokee, and probably of other eastern tribes, was of white
stone, white being the universal peace color. The red stone pipe of the
Sioux was also used in peace ceremonials, from the peculiar sacredness
attached to it among the western tribes.</p>
<p>The accuracy of Wafford&rsquo;s statement from memory in 1891 is
strikingly confirmed by a contemporary account of the great intertribal
council at Tahlequah in 1843, by the artist, Stanley, who was present
and painted a number of portraits on that occasion. The council was
convened by John Ross in June and remained in session four weeks, some
ten thousand Indians being in attendance, representing seventeen
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb486" href="#pb486" name=
"pb486">486</a>]</span>tribes. &ldquo;During the whole session the
utmost good feeling and harmony prevailed. The business was brought to
a close at sundown, after which the various tribes joined in dancing,
which was usually kept up to a late hour.&rdquo; The wampum belt was
explained, according to Stanley&rsquo;s account, by Major George Lowrey
(<i>Agi&#699;l&#301;</i>, &ldquo;Rising&rdquo;), second chief of the
Nation, who thus recited the tradition of its coming from the Seneca
[i. e. Iroquois]. The talk abounds in Indian reference and
symbolism:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will now hear a talk from our forefathers. You must not
think hard if we make a few mistakes in describing our wampum. If we
do, we will try and rectify them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Brothers, you will now hear what our forefathers said to
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, the Senecas, a great many years ago,
devised a plan for us to become friends. When the plan was first laid,
the Seneca rose up and said, I fear the Cherokee, because the tomahawk
is stuck in several parts of his head. The Seneca afterwards remarked,
that he saw the tomahawk still sticking in all parts of the
Cherokee&rsquo;s head, and heard him whooping and hallooing say
[<i>sic</i>] that he was too strong to die. The Seneca further said,
Our warriors in old times used to go to war; when they did go, they
always went to fight the Cherokees; sometimes one or two would return
home&mdash;sometimes none. He further said, The Great Spirit must love
the Cherokees, and we must be in the wrong, going to war with them. The
Seneca then said, Suppose we make friends with the Cherokee, and wash
his wounds and cause them to heal up, that he may grow larger than he
was before. The Seneca, after thus speaking, sat down. The Wyandot then
rose and said, You have done right, and let it be. I am your youngest
brother, and you our oldest. This word was told to the Shawnees; They
replied, We are glad, let it be; you are our elder brothers. The
Senecas then said, they would go about and pray to the Great Spirit for
four years to assist them in making peace, and that they would set
aside a vessel of water and cover it, and at the end of every year they
would take the cover off, and examine the water, which they did; every
time they opened it they found it was changed; at the end of four years
they uncovered the vessel and found that the water had changed to a
colour that suited them. The Seneca then said, The Great Spirit has had
mercy upon us, and the thing has taken place just as we wished it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Shawnee then said, We will make straight paths; but let
us make peace among our neighbouring tribes first, before we make this
path to those afar off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Seneca then said, Before we make peace, we must give our
neighboring tribes some fire; for it will not do to make peace without
it,&mdash;they might be traveling about, and run against each other,
and probably cause them to hurt each other. These three tribes said,
before making peace, that this fire which was to be given to them
should be kindled in order that a big light may be raised, so they may
see each other at a long distance; this is to last so long as the earth
stands; They said further, that this law of peace shall last from
generation to generation&mdash;so long as there shall be a red man
living on this earth: They also said, that the fire shall continue
among us and shall never be extinguished as long as one remains. The
Seneca further said to the Shawnees, I have put a belt around you, and
have tied up the talk in a bundle, and placed it on your backs; we will
now make a path on which we will pass to the Sioux. The Seneca said
further, You shall continue your path until it shall reach the lodge of
the Osage. When the talk was brought to the Sioux, they replied, we
feel thankful to you and will take your talk; we can see a light
through the path you have made for us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Shawnees brought the talk to the Osages, they
replied, By to-morrow, by the middle of the day, we shall have finished
our business. The Osage said further, The Great Spirit has been kind to
me. He has brought something to me, I being fatigued hunting for it.
When the Shawnees returned to the lodge of the Osages, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb487" href="#pb487" name="pb487">487</a>]</span>they
were informed that they were to be killed, and they immediately made
their escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Shawnees returned to their homes whence they came,
they said they had been near being killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Seneca then said to the Shawnees, that the Osages must be
mistaken. The Shawnees went again to see the Osages&mdash;they told
them their business. The Osages remarked, The Great Spirit has been
good to us,&mdash;to-morrow by the middle of the day he will give us
something without fatigue. When the Shawnees arrived at the lodge, an
old man of the Osages told them that they had better make their escape;
that if they did not, by the middle of the following day, they were all
to be destroyed, and directed them to the nearest point of the woods.
The Shawnees made their escape about midday. They discovered the Osages
following them, and threw away their packs, reserving the bag their
talk was in, and arrived at their camp safe. When the Shawnees arrived
home, they said they had come near being killed, and the Osages refused
to receive their talk. The Seneca then said, If the Osages will not
take our talk, let them remain as they are; and when the rising
generation shall become as one, the Osages shall be like some herb
standing alone. The Seneca further said, The Osages shall be like a
lone cherry-tree, standing in the prairies, where the birds of all
kinds shall light upon it at pleasure. The reason this talk was made
about the Osages was, that they prided themselves upon their warriors
and manhood, and did not wish to make peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Seneca further said, we have succeeded in making peace
with all the Northern and neighbouring tribes. The Seneca then said to
the Shawnees, You must now turn your course to the South: you must take
your path to the Cherokees, and even make it into their houses. When
the Shawnees started at night they took up their camp and sat up all
night, praying to the Great Spirit to enable them to arrive in peace
and safety among the Cherokees. The Shawnees still kept their course,
until they reached a place called Tah-le-quah, where they arrived in
safety, as they wished, and there met the chiefs and warriors of the
Cherokees. When they arrived near Tah-le-quah, they went to a house and
sent two men to the head chiefs. The chief&rsquo;s daughter was the
only person in the house. As soon as she saw them, she went out and met
them, and shook them by the hand and asked them into the house to sit
down. The men were all in the field at work&mdash;the girl&rsquo;s
father was with them. She ran and told him that there were two men in
the house, and that they were enemies. The chief immediately ran to the
house and shook them by the hand, and stood at the door. The Cherokees
all assembled around the house, and said, Let us kill them, for they
are enemies. Some of the men said, No, the chief&rsquo;s daughter has
taken them by the hand; so also has our chief. The men then became
better satisfied. The chief asked the two men if they were alone. They
answered, No; that there were some more with them. He told them to go
after them and bring them to his house. When these two men returned
with the rest of their people, the chief asked them what their business
was. They then opened this valuable bundle, and told him that it
contained a talk for peace. The chief told them, I cannot do business
alone; all the chiefs are assembled at a place called Cho-qua-ta [for
E-cho-ta], where I will attend to your business in general council.
When the messengers of peace arrived at Cho-qua-ta, they were kindly
received by the chiefs, who told them they would gladly receive their
talk of peace. The messengers of peace then said to the Cherokees, We
will make a path for you to travel in, and the rising generation may do
the same,&mdash;we also will keep it swept clean and white, so that the
rising generation may travel in peace. The Shawnee further said, We
will keep the doors of our houses open, so that when the rising
generation come among us they shall be welcome. He further said, This
talk is intended for all the different tribes of our red brothers, and
is to last to the end of time. He further said, I have made a fire out
of the dry elm&mdash;this fire is for all <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb488" href="#pb488" name="pb488">488</a>]</span>the different tribes
to see by. I have put one chunk toward the rising sun, one toward the
north, and one toward the south. This fire is not to be extinguished so
long as time lasts. I shall stick up a stick close by this fire, in
order that it may frequently be stirred, and raise a light for the
rising generation to see by; if any one should turn in the dark, you
must catch him by the hand, and lead him to the light, so that he can
see that he was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made you a fire-light, I have stripped some white
hickory bark and set it up against the tree, in order that when you
wish to remove this fire, you can take it and put it on the bark; when
you kindle this fire it will be seen rising up toward the heavens. I
will see it and know it; I am your oldest brother. The messenger of
peace further said, I have prepared white benches for you, and leaned
the white pipe against them, and when you eat you shall have but one
dish and one spoon. We have done everything that was good, but our
warriors still hold their tomahawks in their hands, as if they wished
to fight each other. We will now take their tomahawks from them and
bury them; we must bury them deep under the earth where there is water;
and there must be winds, which we wish to blow them so far that our
warriors may never see them again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The messenger further said, Where there is blood spilt I will
wipe it up clean&mdash;wherever bones have been scattered, I have taken
them and buried them, and covered them with white hickory bark and a
white cloth&mdash;there must be no more blood spilt; our warriors must
not recollect it any more. Our warriors said that the Cherokees were
working for the rising generation by themselves; we must take hold and
help them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The messengers then said that you Cherokees are placed now
under the centre of the sun; this talk I leave with you for the
different tribes, and when you talk it, our voice shall be loud enough
to be heard over this island. This is all I have to
say.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15235src" href="#xd25e15235"
name="xd25e15235src">45</a></p>
<p><i>Wampum</i>&mdash;The celebrated wampum was a species of bead cut
from the shell of the clam, conch, or other shell-bearing mollusk of
the coast or the larger streams. The common name is derived from an
Algonquian word signifying <i>white</i>, and was properly applied only
to one variety, the generic term varying with the tribe. The beads were
rather cylindrical than globular, and were of two colors, white and
purple or dark. They were rated at definite values. The wampum was
manufactured by the coast tribes, being traded by them to those of the
interior, and was largely used everywhere east of the Mississippi for
necklaces, collars, belts, and other purposes of personal adornment, as
well as in connection with the noted wampum belts, by means of which
the memory of treaties and tribal traditions was handed down. These
belts were woven with various designs in wampum, either pictographic or
symbolic, the meaning of which was preserved and explained on public
occasions by an officer appointed to that duty. In ancient times no
treaty or covenant was considered binding, and no tribal embassy was
recognized as official, without the delivery of a wampum belt as a
guaranty and memorial. The colonial documents are full of references to
this custom. Up to the end of the last century the Cherokee still
tendered such belts in their treaties with the Government, and one was
delivered in the same manner so late as the treaty of Prairie des
Chiens in 1825. The Iroquois still preserve several ancient belts, of
which a good idea is afforded by the illustration and accompanying
description (<a href="#fig2">figure 2</a>, page <a href="#fig2" class=
"pageref">354</a>). On account of the high estimation in which these
shell beads were held they were frequently used in the East as a
standard of exchange, as eagle feathers were in the West, and among the
Cherokee the same word, <i>atela</i>, is used alike for bead and for
money. On the Pacific coast, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb489" href=
"#pb489" name="pb489">489</a>]</span>shells were more generally shaped
into pendants and gorgets. For a good eye-witness account of the
manufacture and use of wampum and gorgets of shell among the South
Atlantic tribes, see Lawson, History of Carolina, 315&ndash;316.</p>
<p><a href="#s90">90.</a> <span class="sc">Hiadeoni, the Seneca</span>
(p. <a href="#pb356" class="pageref">356</a>): Of this story
Schoolcraft says: &ldquo;The following incident in the verbal annals of
Iroquois hardihood and heroism was related to me by the intelligent
Seneca, Tetoyoah, William Jones of Cattaraugus, along with other
reminiscences of the ancient Cherokee wars.&rdquo; Hewitt thinks the
proper Seneca form of the name may be
H&#259;ia&prime;di&prime;o&ntilde;n&#301;, signifying &ldquo;His body
lies supine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#s92">92.</a> <span class="sc">Escape of the Seneca
boys</span> (p. <a href="#pb359" class="pageref">359</a>): The
manuscript notes from which this and several following traditions are
arranged are in the archives of the Bureau of American Ethnology, and
were obtained in 1886&ndash;87 among the Seneca Indians of New York by
Mr Jeremiah Curtin, since noted as the author of several standard
collections of Indian and European myths and the translator of the
works of the Polish novelist, Sienkiewicz.</p>
<p><i>Gowe&prime;!</i>&mdash;This is along drawn halloo without

(p. <a href="#pb359" class="pageref">359</a>): The meaning of the
Seneca name can not be given.</p>
<p><i>Animal Protectors</i>&mdash;The leading incident of this tale is
closely paralleled by a Kiowa story, told by the old men as an actual
occurrence of some fifty years ago, concerning a warrior who, having
been desperately wounded in an engagement with Mexican troops in
southern Texas, was abandoned to die by his retreating comrades. At
night, while lying upon the ground awaiting death, and unable to move,
he heard a long howl in the distance, which was repeated nearer and
nearer, until at last he heard the patter of feet in the sand, and a
wolf came up and licked the festering wounds of the warrior with such
soothing effect that he fell asleep. This was repeated several times
until the man was able to sit up, when the wolf left him, after telling
him&mdash;not in the vision of a dream, but as a companion face to
face&mdash;that he must keep up his courage, and that he would get back
in safety to his tribe. Soon afterward the wounded warrior was found by
a party of Comanche, who restored him to his people. At the next Sun
dance he made public thanksgiving for his rescue (see the
author&rsquo;s Calendar History of the Kiowa Indians, in Seventeenth
Annual Report Bureau of American Ethnology, part 1, 1901). The story is
not impossible. A wolf may easily have licked the wounded man&rsquo;s
sores, as a dog might do, and through the relief thus afforded, if not
by sympathy of companionship, have enabled him to hold out until
rescued by friends. The rest is easy to the imagination of an Indian,
who believes that there is no essential difference between himself and
other animals.</p>
<p><i>The War Woman</i>&mdash;The women described as having power to
decide the fate of captives, mentioned also in the next story (<a href=
"#s94">number 94</a>), are evidently the female dignitaries among the
ancient Cherokee known to early writers as &ldquo;War Women&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Pretty Women.&rdquo; Owing to the decay of Cherokee tradition
and custom it is now impossible to gather anything positive on the
subject from Indian informants, but from documentary references it is
apparent that there existed among the Cherokee a custom analogous to
that found among the Iroquois and probably other Eastern tribes, by
which the decision of important questions relating to peace and war was
left to a vote of the women. Among the Iroquois this privilege was
exercised by a council of matrons, the mothers of the tribes. It may
have been the same among the Cherokee, with the &ldquo;Pretty
Woman&rdquo; to voice the decision of the council, or the final
rendering may have been according to the will of the &ldquo;Pretty
Woman&rdquo; herself. The institution served in a measure to mitigate
the evils of war and had its origin in the clan system. Under this
system a captive enemy was still an enemy until he had been adopted
into the tribe, which could only be done through adoption into a clan
and family. As clan descent was reckoned through the women it rested
with them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb490" href="#pb490" name=
"pb490">490</a>]</span>to decide the question of adoption. If they were
favorable all was well, and the captive became at once a member of a
family and clan and of the tribe at large. Otherwise, as a public
enemy, only death remained to him, unless he was ransomed by friends.
The proper Cherokee title of this female arbiter of life and death is
unknown. The clan of the Ani&prime;-Gil&acirc;&prime;h&#301;, or
&ldquo;Long-hairs,&rdquo; is sometimes spoken of as the Pretty-woman
clan, and the office may have been hereditary in that clan. The Seneca
stories imply that there were two of these female officers, but from
Haywood&rsquo;s account there would seem to have been but one. An upper
tributary of Savannah river in Georgia bears the name War-woman
creek.</p>
<p>Timberlake says in 1765 (Memoirs, p. 70): &ldquo;These chiefs or
headmen likewise compose the assemblies of the nation, into which the
war women are admitted, many of the Indian women being as famous in war
as powerful in the council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Hopewell treaty conference in 1785 the principal chief of
Echota, after an opening speech, said: &ldquo;I have no more to say,
but one of our beloved women has, who has borne and raised up
warriors.&rdquo; After delivering a string of wampum to emphasize the
importance of the occasion, &ldquo;the war woman of Chota then
addressed the commissioners.&rdquo; Having expressed her pleasure at
the peace, she continued: &ldquo;I have a pipe and a little tobacco to
give to the commissioners to smoke in friendship. I look on you and the
red people as my children. Your having determined on peace is most
pleasing to me, for I have seen much trouble during the late war. I am
old, but I hope yet to bear children, who will grow up and people our
nation, as we are now to be under the protection of Congress and shall
have no more disturbance. The talk I have given is from the young
warriors I have raised in my town, as well as myself. They rejoice that
we have peace, and we hope the chain of friendship will never more be
broken.&rdquo; Two strings of wampum, a pipe, and some tobacco
accompanied her words (American State Papers; Indian Affairs,
<span class="sc">I</span>, p. 41, 1832).</p>
<p>Haywood says in 1823: &ldquo;The Cherokees had the law or custom of
assigning to a certain woman the office of declaring what punishment
should be inflicted on great offenders; whether, for instance, burning
or other death, or whether they should be pardoned. This woman they
called the pretty woman. Mrs Ward exercised this office when Mrs Bean,
about the year 1776, was taken from the white settlements on the upper
parts of Holston. Being bound and about to be burned on one of the
mounds, the pretty woman interfered and pronounced her pardon&rdquo;
(Nat. and Aborig. Hist. Tenn., p. 278). See also historical note 20,
&ldquo;Peace Towns and Towns of Refuge.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Between two lines of people</i>&mdash;This custom, known to
colonial writers as &ldquo;running the gauntlet,&rdquo; was very common
among the eastern tribes, and was intended not so much to punish the
captive as to test his courage and endurance, with a view to adoption
if he proved worthy. It was practiced only upon warriors, never upon
women or children, and although the blows were severe they were not
intended to be fatal. The prisoner was usually unbound and made to run
along a cleared space in the center of the village toward a certain
goal, and was safe for the time being if he succeeded in reaching
it.</p>

<p><i>Canebrake</i>&mdash;The tall cane reed (<i lang=
"la">Arundinaria</i>), called <i>i&prime;hya</i> by the Cherokee, is
common along the southern streams, as such names as Cany fork, Cut-cane
creek, and Young-cane creek testify. It was greatly valued among the
Indians for fishing rods, blowguns, and baskets, as well as for fodder
for stock. The best canebrakes were famous far and wide, and were
resorted to from long distances in the gathering season. Most of the
cane now used by the East Cherokee for blowguns and baskets is procured
by long journeys on foot to the streams of upper South Carolina, or to
points on the French Broad above Knoxville, Tennessee. <span class=

<p><i>My grandson</i>&mdash;Among all the eastern and plains tribes
this is a term of affectionate address to a dependent or inferior, as
&ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; is a respectful address to one occupying a
superior station, or venerable by reason of age or dignity, both words
being thus used without any reference to kinship. In tribal councils
nearly all the eastern tribes except the Iroquois addressed the
Delaware representatives as &ldquo;grandfather,&rdquo; and in an
Arapaho song of the Ghost dance the Whirlwind is thus addressed.</p>
<p><a href="#s95">95.</a> <span class="sc">Hemp-carrier</span> (p.
<a href="#pb364" class="pageref">364</a>): This story of the old wars
was obtained from Colonel William H. Thomas, who says that
T&acirc;le&prime;danigi&prime;sk&#301; was a chief formerly living near
Valleytown, in Cherokee county. The name is variously rendered
&ldquo;Hemp-carrier,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nettle-carrier,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Flax-toter,&rdquo; from <i>t&acirc;le&prime;ta</i>, the richweed
(<i lang="la">Pilea pumila</i>), a plant with a fibrous stalk from
which the Indians wove thread and cordage. The trail along which the
Seneca came ran from Valley river across the ridge to Cheowa
(Robbinsville) and thence northwest to connect with the &ldquo;great
war path&rdquo; in Tennessee (see historical note 19).</p>
<p><i>Cairns</i>&mdash;Stone cairns were formerly very common along the
trails throughout the Cherokee country, but are now almost gone, having
been demolished by treasure hunters after the occupation of the country
by the whites. They were usually sepulchral monuments built of large
stones piled loosely together above the body to a height of sometimes 6
feet or more, with a corresponding circumference. This method of
interment was used only when there was a desire to commemorate the
death, and every passer-by was accustomed to add a stone to the heap.
The custom is ancient and world-wide, and is still kept up in Mexico
and in many parts of Europe and Asia. Early references to it among the
southern tribes occur in Lederer (1670), Travels, page 10, ed. 1891,
and Lawson (1700), History of Carolina, pages 43 and 78, ed. 1860. The
latter mentions meeting one day &ldquo;seven heaps of stones, being the
monuments of seven Indians that were slain in that place by the
Sinnagers or Troquois [Iroquois]. Our Indian guide added a stone to
each heap.&rdquo; The common name is the Gaelic term, meaning literally
&ldquo;a pile.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Seven wives</i>&mdash;Polygamy was common among the Cherokee, as
among nearly all other tribes, although not often to such an
exaggerated extent as in this instance. The noted chief
Y&acirc;n&ucirc;g&ucirc;&ntilde;sk&#301;, who died in 1839, had two
wives. With the plains tribes, and perhaps with others, the man who
marries the eldest of several daughters has prior claim upon her
unmarried sisters.</p>
<p><a href="#s96">96.</a> <span class="sc">The Seneca
peacemakers</span> (p. <a href="#pb365" class="pageref">365</a>): This
story was told to Schoolcraft by the Seneca more than fifty years ago.
A somewhat similar story is related by Adair (Hist. American Indians,
p. 392) of a young &ldquo;Anantooeah&rdquo; (i. e.,
N&ucirc;nd&#259;weg&#301; or Seneca) warrior taken by the Shawano.</p>
<p><i>Death song</i>&mdash;It seems to have been a chivalrous custom
among the eastern tribes to give to the condemned prisoner who
requested it a chance to recite his warlike deeds and to sing his death
song before proceeding to the final torture. He was allowed the widest
latitude of boasting, even at the expense of his captors and their
tribe. The death song was a chant belonging to the warrior himself or
to the war society of which he was a member, the burden being farewell
to life and defiance to death. When the great Kiowa war chief,
Set-&auml;ngya, burst his shackles at Fort Sill and sprang upon the
soldiers surrounding him, with the deliberate purpose to sell his life
rather than to remain a prisoner, he first sang the war song of his
order, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb492" href="#pb492" name=
"pb492">492</a>]</span>K&acirc;itse&ntilde;&prime;ko, of which the
refrain is: &ldquo;O earth, you remain forever, but we
K&acirc;itse&ntilde;&prime;ko must die&rdquo; (see the author&rsquo;s
Calendar History of the Kiowa Indians, in Seventeenth Annual Report of
the Bureau American Ethnology, part 1, 1901).</p>
<p><a href="#s97">97.</a> <span class="sc">Origin of the
Yonto&ntilde;wisas dance</span> (p. <a href="#pb365" class=
"pageref">365</a>): This is evidently the one called by Morgan (League
of Iroquois, p. 290) the Untowesus. He describes both this and the
Oaskanea as a &ldquo;shuffle dance&rdquo; for women only. The spelling
of the Seneca names in the story is that given in the manuscript.</p>
<p><i>Not to go after</i>&mdash;Morgan, in his work quoted above,
asserts that the Iroquois never made any effort to recover those of
their people who have been captured by the enemy, choosing to consider
them thenceforth as lost to their tribe and kindred. This, if true, is
doubly remarkable, in view of the <span class="corr" id="xd25e15427"
title="Source: wholesele">wholesale</span> adoption of prisoners and
subjugated tribes by the Iroquois.</p>
<p><i>Blazing pine knots</i>&mdash;Torches of seasoned pine knots are
much in use among the Cherokee for lighting up the way on journeys
along the difficult mountain trails by night. Owing to the accumulation
of resin in the knots they burn with a bright and enduring flame, far
surpassing the cloudy glow of a lantern.</p>
<p><i>Wild potatoes</i>&mdash;As is well known, the potato is
indigenous to America, and our first knowledge of it came to us from
the Indians. Many other native tubers were in use among the tribes,
even those which practiced no agriculture, but depended almost entirely
upon the chase. Favorites among the Cherokee are the <i lang=
"la">Cynara scolymus</i> or wild artichoke, and the <i>Phaseolus</i> or
pig potato, the name of the latter, <i>nuna</i>, being now used to
designate the cultivated potato.</p>
<p><i>Sky people</i>&mdash;These spirit messengers are mentioned also
in the story of Hatcino&ntilde;do&ntilde; (<a href="#s94">number
94</a>), another Seneca tradition. Every tribe has its own spirit
creation.</p>
<p><i>Must do all this</i>&mdash;Every sacred dance and religious rite,
as well as almost every important detail of Indian ceremonial, is
supposed to be in accordance with direct instruction from the spirit
world as communicated in a vision.</p>
<p><a href="#s98">98.</a> <span class="sc">Ga&#700;na&rsquo;s
adventures among the Cherokee</span> (p. <a href="#pb367" class=
"pageref">367</a>): This story, from Curtin&rsquo;s Seneca manuscript,
is particularly rich in Indian allusion. The purificatory rite, the
eagle capture, the peace ceremonial, the ballplay, the foot race, and
the battle are all described in a way that gives us a vivid picture of
the old tribal life. The name of the Seneca hero, Ga&#700;na&#700;,
signifies, according to Hewitt, &ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; (cf. Cherokee
<i>g&ucirc;n&#301;</i>, &ldquo;arrow&rdquo;), while the name of the
great eagle, Shada&#700;gea, may, according to the same authority, be
rendered &ldquo;Cloud-dweller.&rdquo; The Seoqgwageono, living east of
the Cherokee and near the ocean, can not be identified. They could not
have been the Catawba, who were known to the Iroquois as Toderigh-rono,
but they may possibly have been the Congaree, Santee, or Sewee, farther
down in South Carolina. In the Seneca form, as here given, <i>ge</i>
(<i>ge&#699;</i>) is a locative, and <i>ono</i>
(<i>o&ntilde;no&ntilde;</i>) a tribal suffix qualifying the root of the
word, the whole name signifying &ldquo;people of, or at, Seoqgwa&rdquo;
(cf. Oyadageono, etc., i. e., Cherokee, p. 186).</p>
<p><i>Go to water</i>&mdash;This rite, as practiced among the Cherokee,
has been already noted in the chapter on stories and story tellers.
Ceremonial purification by water or the sweat bath, accompanied by
prayer and fasting, is almost universal among the tribes as a
preliminary to every important undertaking. With the Cherokee it
precedes the ballplay and the Green-corn dance, and is a part of the
ritual for obtaining long life, for winning the affections of a woman,
for recovering from a wasting sickness, and for calling down prosperity
upon the family at each return of the new moon.</p>
<p><i>Get the eagle feathers</i>&mdash;The Cherokee ritual for
procuring eagle feathers for ceremonial and decorative purposes has
been described in <a href="#s35">number 35</a>, &ldquo;The Bird
Tribes.&rdquo; The Seneca method, as here described, is practically
that in use among all the Indians of the plains, although the hunter is
not usually satisfied with a single feather at a capture. Among certain
western tribes the eagle was sometimes strangled before being stripped
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb493" href="#pb493" name=
"pb493">493</a>]</span>of its feathers, but it was essential that the
body must not be mangled or any blood be drawn. The Pueblos were
sometimes accustomed to take the young eagles from the nest and keep
them in cages for their feathers. A full tail contains twelve large
feathers of the kind used for war bonnets and on the wands of the Eagle
dance.</p>
<p><i>Stockade</i>&mdash;Stockaded villages were common to the Iroquois
and most of the tribes along the Atlantic coast. They are mentioned
also among the Cherokee in some of the exaggerated narratives of the
early Spanish period, but were entirely unknown within the later
colonial period, and it is very doubtful if the nature of the country
would permit such compact mode of settlement.</p>
<p><i>Dancers went forward</i>&mdash;The method of ceremonial approach
here described was probably more or less general among the eastern
tribes. On the plains the visitors usually dismount in sight of the
other camp and advance on foot in slow procession, chanting the
&ldquo;visiting song,&rdquo; while the leader holds out the red stone
pipe, which is the symbol of truce or friendship. For a good
description of such a ceremonial, reproduced from Battey, see the
author&rsquo;s Calendar History of the Kiowa Indians, in the
Seventeenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology. In this
instance the visiting Pawnee carried a flag in lieu of a pipe.</p>
<p>The Cherokee ceremonial is thus described by Timberlake as witnessed
at Citico in 1762: &lsquo;About 100 yards from the town-house we were
received by a body of between three and four hundred Indians, ten or
twelve of which were entirely naked, except a piece of cloth about
their middle, and painted all over in a hideous manner, six of them
with eagles&rsquo; tails in their hands, which they shook and
flourished as they advanced, danced in a very uncommon figure, singing
in concert with some drums of their own make, and those of the late
unfortunate Capt. Damere; with several other instruments, uncouth
beyond description. Cheulah, the headman of the town, led the
procession, painted blood-red, except his face, which was half black,
holding an old rusty broad-sword in his right hand, and an
eagle&rsquo;s tail in his left. As they approached, Cheulah, singling
himself out from the rest, cut two or three capers, as a signal to the
other eagle-tails, who instantly followed his example. This violent
exercise, accompanied by the band of musick, and a loud yell from the
mob, lasted about a minute, when the headman, waving his sword over my
head, struck it into the ground, about two inches from my left foot;
then directing himself to me, made a short discourse (which my
interpreter told me was only to bid me a hearty welcome) and presented
me with a string of beads. We then proceeded to the door, where
Cheulah, and one of the beloved men, taking me by each arm, led me in,
and seated me in one of the first seats; it was so dark that nothing
was perceptible till a fresh supply of canes were brought, which being
burnt in the middle of the house answers both purposes of fuel and
candle. I then discovered about five hundred faces; and Cheulah
addressing me a second time, made a speech much to the same effect as
the former, congratulating me on my safe arrival thro&rsquo; the
numerous parties of northern Indians, that generally haunt the way I
came. He then made some professions of friendship, concluding with
giving me another string of beads, as a token of it. He had scarce
finished, when four of those who had exhibited at the procession made
their second appearance, painted in milk-white, their eagle-tails in
one hand, and small gourds with beads in them in the other, which they
rattled in time to the musick. During this dance the peace-pipe was
prepared.&rdquo;&mdash;Timberlake, Memoirs, pp. 36&ndash;39.</p>
<p>Adair also makes brief mention of the ceremony among the Gulf tribes
(Hist. Am. Indians, p. 260), but his account is too badly warped by
theorizing to have much value.</p>
<p><i>Adopt a relative</i>&mdash;This seems to point to a custom which
has escaped the notice of earlier writers on the eastern tribes, but
which is well known in Africa and other parts of the world, and is
closely analogous to a still existing ceremony among the plains Indians
by which two young men of the same tribe formally agree to become
brothers, and ratify the compact by a public exchange of names and
gifts. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb494" href="#pb494" name=
"pb494">494</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>White wampum</i>&mdash;As is well known, white was universally
typical of peace. The traditional peace-pipe of the Cherokee was of
white stone and the word itself is symbolic of peace and happiness in
their oratory and sacred formulas. Thus the speaker at the Green-corn
dance invites the people to come along the white path and enter the
white house of peace to partake of the new white food.</p>
<p><i>Held up the belt</i>&mdash;As already noted, every paragraph of
an ambassador&rsquo;s speech was accompanied by the delivery of a
string or belt of wampum to give authority to his words, and to accept
the belt was to accept the condition or compact which it typified. On
the plains the red stone pipe took the place of the wampum.</p>
<p><i>Try a race</i>&mdash;Public foot races were common among many
tribes, more particularly in the West among the Pueblos, the Apache,
and the Wichita, either as simple athletic contests or in connection
with religious ceremonials. On the plains the horse race is more in
favor and is always the occasion of almost unlimited betting.</p>
<p><i>Throwing sumac darts</i>&mdash;The throwing of darts and arrows,
either at a mark or simply to see who can throw farthest, is a favorite
amusement among the young men and boys. The arrows used for this
purpose are usually longer and heavier than the ordinary ones, having
carved wooden heads and being artistically painted. They are sometimes
tipped with the end of a buffalo horn.</p>
<p><a href="#s99">99.</a> <span class="sc">The Shawano wars</span> (p.
<a href="#pb370" class="pageref">370</a>): The chief authority as to
the expulsion of the Shawano from Tennessee is Haywood (Natural and
Aboriginal History of Tennessee, pp. 222&ndash;224). The Schoolcraft
reference is from Notes on the Iroquois, p. 160, and the notice of the
Cherokee-Delaware war from Loskiel, Mission of United Brethren, p. 128,
and Heckewelder, Indian Nations, p. 88. The Tun&acirc;&prime;&#301;
story is from Wafford; the other incidents from Swimmer.</p>
<p><i>Shawano</i>&mdash;The Shawano or Shawnee were one of the most
important of the Algonquian tribes. Their most noted chief was the
great Tecumtha. The meaning of the name is doubtful. It is commonly
interpreted &ldquo;Southerners,&rdquo; from the Algonquian
<i>shawan</i>, &ldquo;the south,&rdquo; but may have come from another
Algonquian word signifying &ldquo;salt&rdquo; (<i>siutagan</i>,
<i>sewetagan</i>, etc., from <i>sewan</i>, &ldquo;sweet,
pungent&rdquo;). Unlike the southern Indians generally, the Shawano
were great salt users, and carried on an extensive salt manufacture by
boiling at the salt springs of southwestern Virginia, furnishing the
product in trade to other tribes. They have thirteen clans&mdash;Wolf,
Loon, Bear, Buzzard, Panther, Owl, Turkey, Deer, Raccoon, Turtle,
Snake, Horse, and Rabbit (Morgan), the clan of the individual being
indicated by his name. They are organized also into four divisions or
bands, perhaps originally independent allied tribes, viz, Piqua,
Mequachake, Kiscopocoke, and Chilicothe. To the second of these
belonged the hereditary priesthood, but the first was most prominent
and apparently most numerous. The Shawano were of very wandering and
warlike habit. Their earliest historical habitat appears to have been
on the middle Savannah river, which takes its name from them, but
before the end of the seventeenth century we find a portion of them,
apparently the main body, occupying the basin of the Cumberland river
in Tennessee and the adjacent region of Kentucky. About the year 1692
most of those remaining in South Carolina moved northward and settled
upon the upper Delaware river, with their relatives and friends the
Delaware and Mahican. These emigrants appear to have been of the Piqua
division. Up to about the year 1730 the Shawano still had a town on
Savannah river, near Augusta, from which they were finally driven by
the Cherokee. From their former intimate association with the Uchee,
living in the same neighborhood, some early writers have incorrectly
supposed the two tribes to be the same. A part of the Shawano joined
the Creek confederary, and up to the beginning of the last century, and
probably until the final removal to the West, occupied a separate town
and retained their distinct language. Those settled upon the Cumberland
were afterward expelled by the Cherokee and Chickasaw, and retired to
the upper waters of the Ohio under protection of the Delaware, who had
given refuge to the original emigrants from South <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb495" href="#pb495" name=
"pb495">495</a>]</span>Carolina. With the advance of the white
settlements the two tribes moved westward into Ohio, the Shawano fixing
themselves in the vicinity of the present Piqua and Chillicothe about
the year 1750. They took a leading part in the French and Indian war,
Pontiac&rsquo;s war, the Revolution, and the war of 1812. In 1793 a
considerable band settled in Missouri upon lands granted by the Spanish
government. As a result of successive sales and removals all that
remain of the tribe are now established in Indian Territory, about
one-half being incorporated with the Cherokee Nation. In 1900 they
numbered about 1,580, viz, in Cherokee Nation (in 1898), 790; Absentee
Shawnee of Sac and Fox Agency, 509; Absentee Shawnee of Big Jim&rsquo;s
band, special agency, 184; Eastern Shawnee of Quapaw Agency, 93. There
are also a few scattered among other tribes. For detailed information

"pageref">374</a>): Swimmer, from whom this story was obtained, was of
opinion that the event occurred when his mother was a little girl, say
about 1795, but it must have been earlier.</p>
<p>The locations are all in Swain county, North Carolina.
T&#301;kw&#259;li&prime;ts&#301; town was on Tuckasegee river, at the
present Bryson City, immediately below and adjoining the more important
town of Kituhwa. Deep creek enters the Tuckasegee from the north, about
a mile above Bryson City. The place where the trail crossed is called
Uniga&prime;yata&#699;ti&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Where they made a fish
trap,&rdquo; a name which may have suggested the simile used by the
story teller. The place where the Cherokee crossed, above Deep creek,
is called Uniy&acirc;&prime;hit&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Where they shot it.&rdquo; The cliff over which the prisoners
were thrown is called Kala&prime;&#259;s&ucirc;&ntilde;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Where he fell off,&rdquo; near Cold Spring knob, west of Deep
creek. The Cherokee halted for a night at
Agitsta&#699;ti&prime;y&#301;, &ldquo;Where they staid up all
night,&rdquo; a few miles beyond, on the western head fork of Deep
creek. They passed K&ucirc;nst&ucirc;tsi&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Sassafras place,&rdquo; a gap about the head of Noland creek,
near Clingman&rsquo;s dome, and finally gave up the pursuit where the
trail crossed into Tennessee, at a gap on the main ridge, just below
Clingman&rsquo;s dome, known as
Duniya&prime;&#699;t&acirc;&#699;l&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;y&#301;,
&ldquo;Where there are shelves,&rdquo; so called from an exposure of
flat rock on the top of the ridge (see the <a href=
"#gloss">glossary</a>).</p>
<p><i>Magic arts</i>&mdash;It is almost superfluous to state that no
Indian war party ever started out without a vast deal of conjuring and
&ldquo;making medicine&rdquo; to discover the whereabouts and strength
of the enemy and to insure victory and safe return to the departing
warriors.</p>
<p><i>Wait for death</i>&mdash;The Indian usually meets inevitable fate
with equanimity, and more than once in our Indian wars an aged warrior
or helpless woman, unable to escape, has sat down upon the ground, and,
with blanket drawn over the head, calmly awaited the fatal bullet or
hatchet stroke.</p>
<p><a href="#s101">101.</a> <span class="sc">The last Shawano
invasion</span> (p. <a href="#pb374" class="pageref">374</a>): This
story also is from Swimmer, whose antiquarian interest in the history
of these wars may have been heightened by the fact that he had a slight
strain of Shawano blood himself. The descendants of the old chief
Sawanu&prime;gi and his brothers, originally of Shawano stock, as the
name indicates, have been prominent in the affairs of the East Cherokee
for more than half a century, and one of them, bearing the ancestral
name, is now second chief of the band and starter of the game at every
large ballplay.</p>
<p><i>The cry of an owl</i>&mdash;One of the commonest claims put forth
by the medicine men is that of ability to understand the language of
birds and to obtain supernatural knowledge from them, particularly from
the owl, which is regarded with a species of fear by the laity, as the
embodiment of a human ghost, on account of its nocturnal habit and
generally uncanny appearance. A medicine man who died a few years ago
among the Kiowa claimed to derive his powers from that bird. The body
of an owl, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb496" href="#pb496" name=
"pb496">496</a>]</span>wrapped in red cloth and decorated with various
trinkets, was kept constantly suspended from a tall pole set up in
front of his tipi, and whenever at night the warning cry sounded from
the thicket he was accustomed to leave his place at the fire and go
out, returning in a short while with a new revelation.</p>
<p><i>Rafts</i>&mdash;The Cherokee canoe is hewn from a poplar log and
is too heavy to be carried about like the bark canoe of the northern
tribes. As a temporary expedient they sometimes used a bear or buffalo
skin, tying the legs together at each end to fashion a rude boat. Upon
this the baggage was loaded, while the owner swam behind, pushing it
forward through the water.</p>
<p id="s102n"><a href="#s102">102.</a> <span class="sc">The false
warriors of Chilhowee</span> (p. <a href="#pb375" class=
"pageref">375</a>): This story was given by Swimmer and corroborated by
others as that of an actual incident of the old times. The middle
Cherokee (Kituhwa) settlements, on the head-streams of the Little
Tennessee, were separated from the upper settlements, about its
junction with the main Tennessee, by many miles of extremely rough
mountain country. Dialectic differences and local jealousies bred
friction, which sometimes brought the two sections into collision and
rendered possible such an occurrence as is here narrated. On account of
this jealousy, according to Adair, the first Cherokee war, which began
in 1760, concerned for some time only a part of the tribe.
&ldquo;According to the well-known temper of the Cheerake in similar
cases it might either have remained so, or soon have been changed into
a very hot civil war, had we been so wise as to have improved the
favourable opportunity. There were seven northern towns, opposite to
the middle parts of the Cheerake country, who from the beginning of the
unhappy grievances, firmly dissented from the hostile intentions of
their suffering and enraged countrymen, and for a considerable time
before bore them little good will, on account of some family disputes
which occasioned each party to be more favourable to itself than to the
other. These would readily have gratified their vindictive disposition
either by a neutrality or an offensive alliance with our colonists
against them&rdquo; (History of the American Indians, page 248).</p>
<p>Chilhowee (properly Ts&ucirc;&#699;l&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;we or
Ts&ucirc;&#699;la&prime;w&#301;) was a noted settlement on the south
bank of Little Tennessee river, opposite the present Chilhowee, in
Monroe county, Tennessee. Cowee (properly Kawi&prime;y&#301;,
abbreviated Kawi&prime;) was the name of two or more former
settlements. The one here meant was at the junction of Cowee creek with
Little Tennessee river, a short distance below the present Franklin, in
Macon county, North Carolina. Neither name can be analyzed. The

<p><i>Scalp dance</i>&mdash;This dance, common to every tribe east of
the Rocky mountains, was held to celebrate the taking of fresh scalps
from the enemy. The scalps, painted red on the fleshy side, decorated
and stretched in small hoops attached to the ends of poles, were
carried in the dance by the wives and sweethearts of the warriors,
while in the pauses of the song each warrior in turn recited his
exploits in minute detail. Among the Cherokee it was customary for the
warrior as he stepped into the center of the circle to suggest to the
drummer an improvised song which summed up in one or two words his own
part in the encounter. A new &ldquo;war name&rdquo; was frequently
assumed after the dance (see sketch of
Tsunu&prime;l&#259;h&ucirc;&ntilde;&prime;sk&#301;, page <a href=
"#pb164" class="pageref">164</a>). Dances were held over the same
scalps on consecutive nights or sometimes at short intervals for weeks
together.</p>

<p><a href="#s104">104.</a> <span class="sc">The eastern tribes</span>
(p. <a href="#pb378" class="pageref">378</a>):
<i>Delaware</i>&mdash;The Delawares derive their popular name from the
river upon which, in the earliest colonial period, they had their
principal settlements. They call themselves <i>Lena&prime;pe</i> or
<i>Leni-lena&prime;pe</i>, a term apparently signifying &ldquo;real, or
original men,&rdquo; or &ldquo;men of our kind.&rdquo; To the cognate
tribes of the Ohio valley and the lakes they were known as
<i>Wapanaq&prime;ki</i>, &ldquo;easterners,&rdquo; the name being
extended to include the closely related tribes, the Mahican, Wappinger
(i. e. Wapanaq&prime;ki), Nanticoke, and Conoy. By all the widespread
tribes of kindred Algonquian stock, as well as by the Winnebago,
Wyandot, and Cherokee, they were addressed under the respectful title
of &ldquo;grandfather,&rdquo; the domineering Iroquois alone refusing
to them any higher designation than &ldquo;nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their various bands and subtribes seem originally to have occupied
the whole basin of Delaware river, together with all of New Jersey,
extending north to the watershed of the Hudson and west and southwest
to the ridge separating the waters of the Delaware and Susquehanna.
Immediately north of them, along the lower Hudson and extending into
Massachusetts and Connecticut, were the closely affiliated Mahican and
Wappinger, while to the south were their friends and kindred, the
Nanticoke and Conoy, the former in Delaware and on the eastern shore of
Maryland, the latter between Chesapeake bay and the lower Potomac. All
of these, although speaking different languages of the common
Algonquian stock, asserted their traditional origin from the Delawares,
with whom, in their declining days, most of them were again merged. The
Delawares proper were organized into three divisions, which, according
to Brinton, were subtribes and not clans, although each of the three
had a totemic animal by whose name it was commonly known. These three
subtribes were: (1) The Minsi or Munsee (people of the &ldquo;stony
country&rdquo;?), otherwise known as the Wolf tribe, occupying the hill
country about the head of the Delaware; (2) the Unami (people
&ldquo;downstream&rdquo;), or Turtle tribe, on the middle Delaware, and
(3) the Unalachtgo (people &ldquo;near the ocean&rdquo;?), or Turkey
tribe, in the southern part of the common territory. Of these the
Turtle tribe assumed precedence in the council, while to the Wolf tribe
belonged the leadership in war. Each of these three was divided into
twelve families, or embryonic clans, bearing female names. In this
connection it may be mentioned that the Delawares now residing with the
Wichita, in Oklahoma, still use the figure of a turtle as their
distinctive cattle brand.</p>
<p>Of the history of the Delawares it is only possible to say a very
few words here. Their earliest European relations were with the Dutch
and Swedes. In 1682 they made the famous treaty with William Penn,
which was faithfully observed on both sides for sixty years. Gradually
forced backward by the whites, they retired first to the Susquehanna,
then to the upper Ohio, where, on the breaking out of the French and
Indian war in 1754, they ranged themselves on the side of the French.
They fought against the Americans in the Revolution, and in the war of
1812, having by that time been driven as far west as Indiana. In 1818
they ceded all their lands in that State and were assigned to a
reservation in Kansas, where they were joined by a considerable body
that had emigrated to Missouri, in company with a band of Shawano, some
years before, by permission of the Spanish government. About the close
of the Revolution another portion of the tribe, including most of those
who had been Christianized by Moravian missionaries, had fled from Ohio
and taken up a permanent abode on Canadian soil. In 1867 the main body
of those in Kansas removed to Indian Territory and became incorporated
with the Cherokee Nation. A smaller band settled on the Wichita
reservation in Oklahoma. The present number of Delawares is,
approximately, 1,600, viz: &ldquo;Moravians and Munsees of the
Thames,&rdquo; Ontario, 475; incorporated in Cherokee Nation, 870 (in
1898); on Wichita reservation, 95; Munsee in Kansas and incorporated
with Stockbridges in Wisconsin, perhaps 100; Delawares, etc., with Six
Nations, in New York, 50.</p>
<p>Of their former allies, the Wappinger and Conoy have long since
disappeared <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb498" href="#pb498" name=
"pb498">498</a>]</span>through absorption into other tribes; the
Mahican are represented by a band of about 530 Stockbridge Indians,
including a number of Munsee, in Wisconsin, while about 70 mixed bloods
still keep up the Nanticoke name in southern Delaware.</p>
<p><i>Tuscarora</i>&mdash;The Tuscarora, a southern tribe of the
Iroquoian stock, formerly occupied an extensive territory upon Neuse
river and its branches, in eastern North Carolina, and, like their
northern cousins, seem to have assumed and exercised a certain degree
of authority over all the smaller tribes about them. As early as 1670
Lederer described the Tuscarora &ldquo;emperor&rdquo; as the haughtiest
Indian he had ever met. About the year 1700 Lawson estimated them at
1,200 warriors (6,000 souls?) in 15 towns. In 1711 they rose against
the whites, one of their first acts of hostility being the killing of
Lawson himself, who was engaged in surveying lands which they claimed
as their own. In a struggle extending over about two years they were so
terribly decimated that the greater portion fled from Carolina and took
refuge with their kinsmen and friends, the Iroquois of New York, who
were henceforth known as the Six Nations. The so-called
&ldquo;friendly&rdquo; party, under Chief Blount, was settled upon a
small reservation north of Roanoke river in what is now Bertie county,
North Carolina. Here they gradually decreased by disease and emigration
to the north, until the few who were left sold their last remaining
lands in 1804. The history of the tribe after the removal to the north
is a part of the history of the Iroquois or Six Nations. They number
now about 750, of whom about 380 are on the Tuscarora reservation in
New York, the others upon the Grand River reservation in Ontario.</p>
<p><i>Xuala, Suwali, Sara or Cheraw</i>&mdash;For the identification
and earliest notices of the Sara see <a href="#hn8">historical note
8</a>, &ldquo;De Soto&rsquo;s Route.&rdquo; Their later history is one
of almost constant hostility to the whites until their final
incorporation with the Catawba, with whom they were probably cognate,
about the year 1720. In 1743 they still preserved their distinct
language, and appear to be last mentioned in 1768, when they numbered
about 50 souls living among the Catawba. See Mooney, Siouan Tribes of
the East, bulletin of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1894.</p>
<p><i>Catawba</i>&mdash;The origin and meaning of this name, which
dates back at least two centuries, are unknown. It may possibly come
from the Choctaw through the Mobilian trade jargon. They call
themselves Nieye, which means simply &ldquo;people&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Indians.&rdquo; The Iroquois call them and other cognate tribes
in their vicinity Toderigh-rono, whence Tutelo. In the seventeenth
century they were often known as Esaw or Ushery, apparently from
<i>isw&#259;&prime;</i>, river, in their own language. The Cherokee
name Ata&prime;gwa, plural Ani&prime;ta&prime;gwa, is a corruption of
the popular form. Their linguistic affinity with the Siouan stock was
established by Gatschet in 1881. See Mooney, Siouan Tribes of the
East.</p>
<p><a href="#s105">105.</a> <span class="sc">The southern and western
tribes</span> (p. <a href="#pb382" class="pageref">382</a>): <i>The
Creek confederacy</i>&mdash;Next in importance to the Cherokee, among
the southern tribes, were the Indians of the Creek confederacy,
occupying the greater portion of Georgia and Alabama, immediately south
of the Cherokee. They are said to have been called Creeks by the early
traders on account of the abundance of small streams in their country.
Before the whites began to press upon them their tribes held nearly all
the territory from the Atlantic westward to about the watershed between
the Tombigby and the Pearl and Pascagoula rivers, being cut off from
the Gulf coast by the Choctaw tribes, and from the Savannah, except
near the mouth, by the Uchee, Shawano, and Cherokee. About the year
1800 the confederacy comprised 75 towns, the people of 47 of which were
the Upper Creeks, centering about the upper waters of the Alabama,
while those of the remaining 28 were the Lower Creeks, upon the lower
Chattahoochee and its branches (Hawkins). Among them were represented a
number of tribes formerly distinct and speaking distinct languages. The
ruling tribe and language was the Muscogee (plural, Muscog&ucirc;lgee),
which frequently gave its name to the confederacy. Other languages were
the Alabama, Koasati, Hichitee, Taskigi, Uchee, Natchee, and Sawanugi
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb499" href="#pb499" name=
"pb499">499</a>]</span>or Shawano. The Muscogee, Alabama, Koasati,
Hichitee, and Taskigi (?) belonged to the Muskhogean stock, the Alabama
and Koasati, however, being nearer linguistically to the Choctaw than
to the Muscogee. The Hichitee represent the conquered or otherwise
incorporated Muskhogean tribes of the Georgia coast region. The
Apalachi on Appalachee bay in Florida, who were conquered by the
English about 1705 and afterward incorporated with the Creeks, were
dialectically closely akin to the Hichitee; the Seminole also were
largely an offshoot from this tribe. Of the Taskigi all that is known
has been told elsewhere (see <a href="#s105">number 105</a>).</p>
<p>The Uchee, Natchee, and Sawanugi were incorporated tribes, differing
radically in language from each other and from the Muskhogean tribes.
The territory of the Uchee included both banks of the middle Savannah,
below the Cherokee, and extended into middle Georgia. They had a strong
race pride, claiming to be older in the country than the Muscogee, and
are probably identical with the people of Cofitachiqui, mentioned in
the early Spanish narratives. According to Hawkins, their incorporation
with the Creeks was brought about in consequence of intermarriages
about the year 1729. The Natchee or Natchez were an important tribe
residing in lower Mississippi, in the vicinity of the present town of
that name, until driven out by the French about the year 1730, when
most of them took refuge with the Creeks, while others joined the
Chickasaw and Cherokee. The Sawanugi were Shawano who kept their town
on Savannah river, near the present Augusta, after the main body of
their tribe had removed to the north about 1692. They probably joined
the Creeks about the same time as their friends, the Uchee. The Uchee
still constitute a compact body of about 600 souls in the Creek Nation,
keeping up their distinct language and tribal character. The Natchee
are reduced to one or two old men, while the Sawanugi have probably
lost their identity long ago.</p>
<p>According to Morgan, the Muscogee proper, and perhaps also their
incorporated tribes, have 22 clans. Of these the Wind appears to be the
leading one, possessing privileges accorded to no other clan, including
the hereditary guardianship of the ancient metal tablets which
constitute the palladium of the tribe. By the treaty of Washington in
1832, the Creeks sold all of their remaining lands in their old country
and agreed to remove west of the Mississippi to what is now the Creek
Nation in the Indian Territory. The removal extended over a period of
several years and was not finally accomplished until 1845. In 1898 the
citizen population of the Creek Nation numbered 14,771, of whom 10,014
were of Indian blood and the remainder were negroes, their former
slaves. It appears that the Indian population included about 700 from
other tribes, chiefly Cherokee. There are also about 300 Alabama,
&ldquo;Cushatta&rdquo; (Koasati), and Muscogee in Texas. See also
Hawkins, Sketch of the Creek Country; Gatschet, Creek Migration Legend;
Adair, History of the American Indians; Bartram, Travels; The Five
Civilized Tribes, Bulletin of the Eleventh Census; Wyman, in Alabama
Historical Society Collections.</p>
<p><i>Chickasaw</i>&mdash;This tribe, of Muskhogean stock, formerly
occupied northern Mississippi and adjacent portions of Alabama and
Tennessee, and at an early period had incorporated also several smaller
tribes on Yazoo river in central Mississippi, chief among which were
the cognate Chokchuma. The name occurs first in the De Soto narrative.
The Chickasaw language was simply a dialect of Choctaw, although the
two tribes were hereditary enemies and differed widely in character,
the former being active and warlike, while the latter were notoriously
sluggish. Throughout the colonial period the Chickasaw were the
constant enemies of the French and friends of the English, but they
remained neutral in the Revolution. By the treaty of Pontotoc in 1832
they sold their lands east of the Mississippi and agreed to remove to
Indian Territory, where they are now organized as the Chickasaw Nation.
According to Morgan they have 12 clans grouped into two phratries. In
1890, the citizen population of the Nation (under Chickasaw laws)
consisted of 3,941 full-blood and mixed-blood Chickasaw, 681 adopted
whites, 131 adopted negroes, and 946 <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb500" href="#pb500" name="pb500">500</a>]</span>adopted Indians from
other tribes, chiefly Choctaws. Under the present law, by which
citizenship claims are decided by a Government commission,
&ldquo;Chickasaw by blood&rdquo; are reported in 1898 to number 4,230,
while &ldquo;white and negro&rdquo; citizens are reported at 4,818. See
also Gatschet, Creek Migration Legend; The Five Civilized Tribes,
Bulletin of Eleventh Census.</p>
<p><i>The Choctaw confederacy</i>&mdash;This was a loose alliance of
tribes, chiefly of Muskhogean stock, occupying southern Alabama and
Mississippi, with the adjacent Gulf coast of western Florida and
eastern Louisiana. The Choctaw proper, of Muskhogean stock, occupying
south central Mississippi, was the dominant tribe. Smaller tribes more
or less closely affiliated were the Mobilian, Tohome, Mugulasha,
Pascagoula, Biloxi, Acolapissa, Bayagoula, Houma, with others of less
note. It had been assumed that all of these were of Muskhogean stock
until Gatschet in 1886 established the fact that the Biloxi were of
Siouan affinity, and it is quite probable that the Pascagoula also were
of the same connection. All the smaller tribes excepting the Biloxi
were practically extinct, or had entirely lost their identity, before
the year 1800.</p>
<p>The Choctaw were one of the largest of the eastern tribes, being
exceeded in numbers, if at all, only by the Cherokee; but this apparent
superiority was neutralized by their unwarlike character and lack of
cohesion. According to Morgan, whose statement has, however, been
challenged, they had eight clans grouped into two phratries. There was
also a geographic division into &ldquo;Long towns,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Potato-eating towns,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Six towns,&rdquo; the
last named differing considerably in dialect and custom from the
others. By treaties in 1820 and 1830 the Choctaw sold all their lands
east of the Mississippi and agreed to remove to Indian Territory, where
they now constitute the Choctaw Nation. A considerable number of
vagrant Choctaw who had drifted into Louisiana and Arkansas at an early
period have since joined their kindred in Indian Territory, but from
1,000 to 2,000 are still scattered along the swampy Gulf coast of
Mississippi. In 1890 those of pure or mixed Choctaw blood in the
Choctaw Nation were officially reported to number 10,211. In 1899,
under different conditions of citizenship, the &ldquo;Choctaw by
blood&rdquo; were put at 14,256, while the adopted whites and negroes
numbered 5,150. See also Gatschet, Creek Migration Legend; The Five
Civilized Tribes, Bulletin of Eleventh Census.</p>
<p><i>The Osage</i>&mdash;The popular name is a corruption of Ouasage,
the French spelling of Wasash, the name used by themselves. The Osage
were the principal southern Siouan tribe, claiming at one time nearly
the whole territory from the Missouri to the Arkansas and from the
Mississippi far out into the plains. Their geographic position brought
them equally into contact with the agricultural and sedentary tribes of
the eastern country and the roving hunters of the prairie, and in
tribal habit and custom they formed a connecting link between the two.
Whether or not they deserved the reputation, they were considered by
all their neighbors as particularly predatory and faithless in
character, and had consequently few friends, but were generally at war
with all tribes alike. They made their first treaty with the Government
in 1808. In 1825 they ceded all their claims in Missouri and Arkansas,
together with considerable territory in what is now Kansas. They have
decreased terribly from war and dissipation, and are now, to the number
of about 1,780, gathered upon a reservation in Oklahoma just west of
the Cherokee and south of the Kansas line.</p>
<p><a href="#s106">106.</a> <span class="sc">The Giants from the
west</span> (p. <a href="#pb391" class="pageref">391</a>): This may be
an exaggerated account of a visit from some warriors of a taller tribe
from the plains, where it is customary to pluck out the eyebrows and to
wear the hair in two long side pendants, wrapped round with otter skin
and reaching to the knees, thus giving a peculiar expression to the
eyes and an appearance of tallness which is sometimes deceptive. The
Osage warriors have, however, long been noted for their height.</p>
<p>With the exception of Tsul&#699;kal&ucirc;&prime; there seem to be
no giants in the mythology of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb501"
href="#pb501" name="pb501">501</a>]</span>the Cherokee, although all
their woods and waters are peopled by invisible fairy tribes. This
appears to be characteristic of Indian mythologies generally, the
giants being comparatively few in number while the &ldquo;little
people&rdquo; are legion. The Iroquois have a story of an invasion by a
race of stony-skinned cannibal giants from the west (Schoolcraft, Notes
on Iroquois, p. 266). Giant races occur also in the mythologies of the
Navaho (Matthews, Navaho Legends), Choctaw (Gatschet, Creek Migration
Legend), and other tribes. According to the old Spanish chroniclers,
Ayllon in 1520 met on the coast of South Carolina a tribe of Indians
whose chiefs were of gigantic size, owing, as he was told, to a special
course of dieting and massage to which they were subjected in
infancy.</p>
<p><a href="#s107">107.</a> <span class="sc">The lost Cherokee</span>
(p. <a href="#pb391" class="pageref">391</a>): This tradition as here
given is taken chiefly from the Wahnenauhi manuscript. There is a
persistent belief among the Cherokee that a portion of their people
once wandered far to the west or southwest, where they were sometimes
heard of afterward, but were never again reunited with their tribe. It
was the hope of verifying this tradition and restoring his lost kinsmen
to their tribe that led Sequoya to undertake the journey on which he
lost his life. These traditional lost Cherokee are entirely distinct
from the historic emigrants who removed from the East shortly after the
Revolution.</p>
<p>Similar stories are common to nearly all the tribes. Thus the Kiowa
tell of a chief who, many years ago, quarreled over a division of game
and led his people far away across the Rocky mountains, where they are
still living somewhere about the British border and still keeping their
old Kiowa language. The Tonkawa tell of a band of their people who in
some way were cut off from the tribe by a sudden inroad of the sea on
the Texas coast, and, being unable to return, gradually worked their
way far down into Mexico. The Tuscarora tell how, in their early
wanderings, they came to the Mississippi and were crossing over to the
west side by means of a grapevine, when the vine broke, leaving those
on the farther side to wander off until in time they became enemies to
those on the eastern bank. See Mooney, Calendar History of the Kiowa
Indians, Seventeenth Annual Report Bureau of American Ethnology, part
1, and The Last of Our Cannibals, in Harper&rsquo;s Magazine, August,
1901; Cusick, quoted in Schoolcraft, Notes on the Iroquois, p. 478.</p>

he carried in his stomach and could produce from his mouth at will. The
Kiowa assert that it was this knife, which of course the soldiers
failed to find when disarming him, with which he attacked the guard in
the encounter that resulted in his death.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Cherokee &ldquo;War Women,&rdquo; who were admitted
to the tribal councils, Timberlake says (Memoirs, p. 70): &ldquo;The
reader will not be a little surprised to find the story of Amazons not
so great a fable as we imagined, many of the Indian women being as
famous in war as powerful in the Council.&rdquo;</p>

constant fire: The old sacred things</span> (p. <a href="#pb395" class=
"pageref">395</a>): What is here said concerning the mounds, based
chiefly upon Swimmer&rsquo;s recital, is given solely <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb502" href="#pb502" name="pb502">502</a>]</span>as a
matter of popular belief, shaped by tribal custom and ritual. The
question of fact is for the archeologist to decide. The Indian
statement is of value, however, in showing the supposed requirements
for the solemn consecration of an important work.</p>
<p>A note by John Howard Payne upon the sacred square of the Creeks, as
observed by him in 1835, just before his visit to the Cherokee, may
throw further light on the problem: &ldquo;In the center of this outer
square was a very high circular mound. This, it seems, was formed from
the earth accumulated yearly by removing the surface of the sacred
square thither. At every Green-corn festival the sacred square is
strewn with soil yet untrodden; the soil of the year preceding being
taken away, but preserved as above explained. No stranger&rsquo;s foot
is allowed to press the new earth of the sacred square until its
consecration is complete&rdquo; (Letter of 1835 in Continental Monthly,
New York, 1862, p. 19). See note on the sacred fire.</p>
<p><i>Conjured with disease</i>&mdash;The practice of conjuring certain
favorite spots in order to render them fatal to an invading enemy was
common to many if not to all tribes. One of the most terrible battles
of the Creek war was fought upon the &ldquo;Holy ground,&rdquo; so
called because it was believed by the Indians that in consequence of
the mystic rites which had been performed there for that purpose by
their prophets, no white troops could set foot upon it and live.</p>
<p><i>The sacred fire</i>&mdash;The method described for producing fire
and keeping it constantly smoldering in the townhouse appears to have
been that actually in use in ancient times, as indicated by the name
given to the plant (<i>atsil&prime;-s&ucirc;&ntilde;t&#301;</i>), and
corroborated by the unanimous testimony of the old people. All the
older East Cherokee believe that the ancient fire still burns within
the mounds at Franklin and Bryson City, and those men who were
stationed for a time near the latter place while in the Confederate
service, during the Civil war, assert that they frequently saw the
smoke rising from the adjacent mound.</p>
<p>The missionary Buttrick, from old Cherokee authority, says:
&ldquo;They were obliged to make new fire for sacred purposes by
rubbing two pieces of dry wood together, with a certain weed, called
golden rod, dry, between them&#8202;&hellip;. When their enemies
destroyed the house in which this holy fire was kept, it was said the
fire settled down into the earth, where it still lives, though unknown
to the people. The place where they lost this holy fire is somewhere in
one of the Carolinas&rdquo; (Antiquities, p. 9).</p>
<p>The general accuracy of Swimmer&rsquo;s account is strikingly
confirmed by the description of the New-fire ceremony given more than
half a century before by John Howard Payne, the poet, who had gone
among the Cherokee to study their ethnology and was engaged in that
work when arrested, together with John Ross, by the Georgia guard in
1835. He makes the kindling of the new fire a part of the annual spring
festival. At that time, says Payne, &ldquo;the altar in the center of
the national heptagon [i.e. townhouse] was repaired. It was constructed
of a conical shape, of fresh earth. A circle was drawn around the top
to receive the fire of sacrifice. Upon this was laid, ready for use,
the inner bark of seven different kinds of trees. This bark was
carefully chosen from the east side of the trees, and was clear and
free from blemish.&rdquo; After some days of preliminary purification,
sacrifice, and other ceremonial performances, the day appointed for the
kindling of the new fire arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early in the morning the seven persons who were commissioned
to kindle the fire commenced their operations. One was the official
fire-maker; the remaining six his assistants. A hearth was carefully
cleared and prepared. A round hole being made in a block of wood, a
small quantity of dry golden-rod weed was placed in it. A stick, the
end of which just fitted the opening, was whirled rapidly until the
weed took fire. The flame was then kindled on the hearth and thence
taken to every house by the women, who collectively waited for that
purpose. The old fires having been everywhere extinguished, and the
hearths cleansed, new fires were lighted <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb503" href="#pb503" name="pb503">503</a>]</span>throughout the
country, and a sacrifice was made in each one of them of the first meat
killed afterwards by those to whom they respectively
belonged.&rdquo;&mdash;Payne MS, quoted in Squier, Serpent Symbol, pp.
116&ndash;118.</p>
<p>Similar ceremonies were common to many tribes, particularly the
southern tribes and the Pueblos, in connection with the annual kindling
of the sacred new fire. See Adair, History of the American Indians;
Hawkins, Sketch of the Creek Country, quoted by Gatschet, Creek
Migration Legend; Bartram, Travels; Fewkes, The New-fire Ceremony at
Walpi, in American Anthropologist for January, 1900; Squier, Serpent
Symbol. Going beyond our own boundaries it may be said briefly that
fire worship was probably as ancient as ritual itself and well-nigh as
universal.</p>
<p><i>Wooden box</i>&mdash;The sacred ark of the Cherokee is described
by Adair (History of the American Indians, pp. 161&ndash;162), and its
capture by the Delawares is mentioned by Washburn (Reminiscences, pp.
191, 221), who states that to its loss the old priests of the tribe
ascribed the later degeneracy of their people. They refused to tell him
the contents of the ark. On this subject Adair says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman who was at the Ohio in the year 1756 assured me
he saw a stranger there very importunate to view the inside of the
Cheerake ark, which was covered with a drest deerskin and placed on a
couple of short blocks. An Indian centinel watched it, armed with a
hiccory bow and brass-pointed barbed arrows; and he was faithful to his
trust, for finding the stranger obtruding to pollute the supposed
sacred vehicle, he drew an arrow to the head, and would have shot him
through the body had he not suddenly withdrawn. The interpreter, when
asked by the gentleman what it contained, told him there was nothing in
it but a bundle of conjuring traps. This shews what conjurers our
common interpreters are, and how much the learned world have really
profited by their informations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such tribal palladiums or &ldquo;medicines,&rdquo; upon which the
existence and prosperity of the tribe are supposed to depend, are still
preserved among the plains Indians, the sacred receptacle in each case
being confided to the keeping of a priest appointed for the purpose,
who alone is privileged to undo the wrappings or expose the contents.
Among these tribal &ldquo;medicines&rdquo; may be mentioned the sacred
arrows of the Cheyenne, the &ldquo;flat pipe&rdquo; of the Arapaho, the
great shell of the Omaha, and the taime image of the Kiowa (see
reference in the author&rsquo;s Ghost-dance Religion and Calendar
History of the Kiowa Indians).</p>
<p><i>White peace pipe</i>&mdash;This statement concerning the ancient
seven-stem peace pipe carved from white stone is given on the authority
of Swimmer, who said that the stone was procured from a quarry near the
present town of Knoxville, Tennessee. A certain district of western
North Carolina has recently acquired an unenviable reputation for the
manufacture of spurious &ldquo;Indian pipes,&rdquo; ostensibly taken
from the mounds, carved from soapstone and having from three to half a
dozen stem-holes encircling the bowl.</p>
<p><i>Turtle drum</i>&mdash;This statement is on the authority of
Wafford, who had talked with men who claimed to have known those who
had seen the drum. He was not positive as to the town, but thought it
was Keowee. It is believed that the drum was hidden by the Indians, in
anticipation of their speedy return, when the country was invaded by
Williamson in 1776, but as the country was never recovered by the
Cherokee the drum was lost.</p>
<p><a href="#s112">112</a>&ndash;<a href="#s115">115</a>. <span class=
"sc">Short humorous stories</span> (pp. <a href="#pb397" class=
"pageref">397</a>, <a href="#pb399" class="pageref">399</a>): These
short stories are fairly representative of Cherokee humor. Each was
heard repeatedly from several informants, both east and west.</p>
<p><a href="#s116">116.</a> <span class="sc">The star feathers</span>
(p. <a href="#pb399" class="pageref">399</a>): This story was obtained
from John Ax, with additional details from Chief Smith and others, to
whom it was equally familiar. It is told as an actual happening in the
early days, before the Indian had much acquaintance with the whites,
and is thoroughly characteristic of the methods of medicine-men.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb504" href="#pb504" name=
"pb504">504</a>]</span>The deception was based upon the Cherokee belief
that the stars are living creatures with feathers (see <a href=
"#s9">number 9</a>, &ldquo;What the Stars are Like&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The Indian has always been noted for his love of feather
decorations, and more than any from his native birds he prized the
beautiful feathers of the peacock whenever it was possible to procure
them from the whites. So far back as 1670 Lederer noted of a South
Carolina tribe: &ldquo;The Ushery delight much in feather ornament, of
which they have great variety; but peacocks in most esteem, because
rare in these parts&rdquo; (Travels, p. 32, ed. 1891).</p>
<p><a href="#s117">117.</a> <span class="sc">The mother bear&rsquo;s
song</span> (p. <a href="#pb400" class="pageref">400</a>): The first of
these songs was obtained from Ay&acirc;sta, and was unknown to Swimmer.
The second song was obtained also from Ay&acirc;sta, who knew only the
verses, while Swimmer knew both the verses and the story which gives
them their setting.</p>
<p>The first has an exact parallel among the Creeks, which is thus
given in the &ldquo;Baby Songs&rdquo; of the Tuggle manuscript:</p>

<p><a href="#s120">120.</a> <span class="sc">The Raven Mocker</span>
(p. <a href="#pb401" class="pageref">401</a>): The grewsome belief in
the &ldquo;Raven Mocker&rdquo; is universal among the Cherokee and has
close parallels in other tribes. Very near to it is the Iroquois belief
in the vampire or cannibal ghost, concerning which Schoolcraft relates
some blood-curdling stories. He says: &ldquo;It is believed that such
doomed spirits creep into the lodges of men at night, and during sleep
suck their blood and eat their flesh. They are invisible&rdquo; (Notes
on the Iroquois, p. 144). On one occasion, while the author was among
the Cherokee, a sick man was allowed to die alone because his friends
imagined they felt the presence of the Raven Mocker or other invisible
witches about the house, and were consequently afraid to stay with him.
The description of the flying terror appears to be that of a great
meteor. It is a universal principle of folk belief that discovery or
recognition while disguised in another form brings disaster to the
witch. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb505" href="#pb505" name=
"pb505">505</a>]</span></p>
<p>The &ldquo;diving&rdquo; of the raven while flying high in air is
performed by folding one wing close to the body, when the bird falls to
a lower plane, apparently turning a somersault in the descent. It seems
to be done purely for amusement.</p>
<p><a href="#s121">121.</a> <span class="sc">Herbert&rsquo;s
spring</span> (p. <a href="#pb403" class="pageref">403</a>): The
subject of this old trader&rsquo;s legend must have been one of the
head-springs of Chattooga river, an upper branch of Savannah, having
its rise in the southern part of Jackson county, North Carolina, on the
eastern slope of the ridge from which other streams flow in the
opposite direction to join the waters of the Tennessee. It was probably
in the vicinity of the present highlands in Macon county, where the
trail from Chattooga river and the settlements on Keowee crossed the
Blue ridge, thence descending Cullasagee to the towns on Little
Tennessee.</p>
<p><a href="#s126">126.</a> <span class="sc">Plant lore</span> (p.
<a href="#pb420" class="pageref">420</a>): For ceremonies, prayers, and
precautions used by the doctors in connection with the gathering and
preparation of medicinal roots, barks, and herbs, see the
author&rsquo;s Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees, in the Seventh Annual
Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1891.</p>
<p><i>Violet</i>&mdash;The Onondaga name signifies &ldquo;two heads
entangled,&rdquo; referring, we are told, to &ldquo;the way so often
seen where the heads are interlocked and pulled apart by the
stems&rdquo; (W. M. Beauchamp, in Journal of American Folk-Lore,
October, 1888).</p>
<p><i>Cedar</i>&mdash;For references to the sacred character of the
cedar among the plains tribes, see the author&rsquo;s Ghost-dance
Religion, in the Fourteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology,
part 2, 1896.</p>
<p><i>Linn and basswood</i>&mdash;The ancient Tuscarora believed that
no tree but black gum was immune from lightning, which, they declared,
would run round the tree a great many times seeking in vain to effect
an entrance. Lawson, who records the belief, adds: &ldquo;Now, you must
understand that sort of gum will not split or rive: therefore, I
suppose the story might arise from thence&rdquo; (Carolina, pp.
345&ndash;346, ed. 1860). The Pawnee claim the same immunity for the
cedar, and throw sprigs of it as incense upon the fire during storms to
turn aside the lightning stroke (Grinnell, Pawnee Hero Stories, p.
126).</p>
<p><i>Ginseng</i>&mdash;For more concerning this plant see the
author&rsquo;s Sacred Formulas, above mentioned. <span class=

<h2 class="main">GLOSSARY OF CHEROKEE WORDS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Cherokee language has the continental vowel sounds
<i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, and <i>u</i>, but lacks <i>o</i>, which
is replaced by a deep <i>&acirc;</i>. The obscure or short
<i>&ucirc;</i> is frequently nasalized, but the nasal sound is seldom
heard at the end of a word. The only labial is <i>m</i>, which occurs
in probably not more than half a dozen words in the Upper and Middle
dialects, and is entirely absent from the Lower dialect, in which
<i>w</i> takes its place. The characteristic <i>l</i> of the Upper and
Middle dialects becomes <i>r</i> in the Lower, but no dialect has both
sounds. There is also an aspirated <i>l</i>; <i>k</i> and <i>t</i> have
the ordinary sounds of these letters, but <i>g</i> and <i>d</i> are
medials, approximating the sounds of <i>k</i> and <i>t</i>,
respectively. A frequent double consonant is <i>ts</i>, commonly
rendered <i>ch</i> by the old traders (see p. <a href="#pb188" class=
"pageref">188</a>, &ldquo;Dialects&rdquo;).</p>

forms and etymologies are doubtful, neither form seeming to have any
reference either to &ldquo;sky&rdquo;

<p>Istanare&mdash;see <i>U&#699;st&#259;na&prime;l&#301;</i>.</p>
<p>I&#699;s&ucirc;&prime;nig&ucirc;&mdash;an important Cherokee

river, about the mouth of Conneross creek, in Oconee county, South

Seneca.</p>

<p>It&#259;g&ucirc;&prime;n&#259;h&#301;&mdash;the Cherokee name of
John Ax.</p>
<p>I&prime;t&#259;w&#259;&prime;&mdash;The name of one or more Cherokee
settlements. One, which existed until the Removal in 1838, was upon
Etowah river, about the present Hightower, in Forsyth county Georgia.
Another may have been on Hightower creek of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb523" href="#pb523" name=
"pb523">523</a>]</span>Hiwassee river in Towns county, Georgia. The
name, commonly written Etowah and corrupted to Hightower, cannot be
translated and seems not to be of Cherokee origin. A town called Itaba,
Ytaua or Ytava in the De Soto chronicles existed in 1540 among the
Creeks, apparently on Alabama river.</p>
<p>Its&#259;&prime;t&#301;&mdash;commonly spelled Echota, Chota, Chote,
Choquata (misprint), etc; a name occurring in several places in the old
Cherokee country: the meaning is lost. The most important settlement of
this name, frequently distinguished as Great Echota, was on the south
side of Little Tennessee river a short distance below Citico creek in
Monroe county, Tennessee. It was the ancient capital and sacred
&ldquo;peace town&rdquo; of the Nation. Little Echota was on Sautee (i.
e., <i>Its&acirc;&prime;t&#301;</i>) creek, a head stream of the
Chattahoochee, west of Clarkesville, Georgia. New Echota, the capital
of the Nation for some years before the Removal, was established at a
spot originally known as <i>G&#259;nsa&prime;g&#301;</i> (q. v.) at the
junction of the Oostanaula and Conasauga rivers, in Gordon county,
Georgia. It was sometimes called Newtown. The old Macedonia mission on
Soco creek, of the North Carolina reservation, is also known as
Its&acirc;&prime;t&#301; to the Cherokee, as was also the great
Nacoochee mound. See <i>Nagu&#699;ts&#301;&prime;</i>.</p>
<p>Itse&prime;y&#301;&mdash;&ldquo;New green place&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Place of fresh green,&rdquo; from <i>itse&prime;h&#301;</i>,
&ldquo;green or unripe vegetation,&rdquo; and <i>y&#301;</i>, the
locative; applied more particularly to a tract of ground made green by
fresh-springing vegetation, after having been cleared of timber or
burned over. A name occurring in several places in the old Cherokee
country, variously written Echia, Echoee, Etchowee, and sometimes also
falsely rendered &ldquo;Brasstown,&rdquo; from a confusion of
<i>Itse&prime;y&#301;</i> with
<i>&ucirc;&ntilde;tsaiy&#301;&prime;</i>, &ldquo;brass.&rdquo; One
settlement of this name was upon Brasstown creek of Tugaloo river, in
Oconee county, South Carolina; another was on Little Tennessee river
near the present Franklin, Macon county, North Carolina, and probably
about the junction of Cartoogaja (<i>Gatug-itse&prime;y&#301;</i>)
creek; a third, known to the whites as Brasstown, was on upper
Brasstown creek of Hiwassee river, in Towns county, Georgia. In
Cherokee as in most other Indian languages no clear distinction is made
between green and blue (<i>sa&#699;ka&prime;nige&prime;&#301;</i>).</p>
<p>i&prime;ya&mdash;pumpkin.</p>
<p>iya&prime;-iyu&prime;st&#301;&mdash;&ldquo;like a pumpkin,&rdquo;
